1269:	Unit 1 - Using Objects and Methods.........................................................
1270:	1.1 - Introduction to Algorithms, Programming, and Compilers...............................
1271:	   1.1.1 - Represent patterns and algorithms found in everyday life using written 
1272:	              language or diagrams.
1273:	      1.1.1.1 - Algorithms define step-by-step processes to follow when completing 
1274:	                 a task or solving a problem. These algorithms can be represented using written 
1275:	                 language or diagrams.
1276:	      1.1.1.2 - Sequencing defines an order for when steps in a process are completed. 
1277:	                 Steps in a process are completed one at a time.
1278:	   1.1.2 - Explain the code compilation and execution process. 
1279:	      1.1.2.1 - Code can be written in any text editor; however, an integrated development 
1280:	                 environment (IDE) is often used to write programs because it provides tools 
1281:	                 for a programmer to write, compile, and run code. 
1282:	      1.1.2.2 - A compiler checks code for some errors. Errors detectable by the 
1283:	                 compiler need to be fixed before the program can be run.
1284:	   1.1.3 - Identify types of programming errors.
1285:	      1.1.3.1 - A syntax error is a mistake in the program where the rules of the 
1286:	                 programming language are not followed. These errors are detected by the compiler. 
1287:	      1.1.3.2 - A logic error is a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes 
1288:	                 it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly. These errors are detected by testing 
1289:	                 the program with specific data to see if it produces the expected outcome. 
1290:	      1.1.3.3 - A run-time error is a mistake in the program that occurs during 
1291:	                 the execution of a program. Run-time errors typically cause the program to 
1292:	                 terminate abnormally. 
1293:	      1.1.3.4 - An exception is a type of run-time error that occurs as a result 
1294:	                 of an unexpected error that was not detected by the compiler. It interrupts 
1295:	                 the normal flow of the program's execution.

1299:	1.2 - Variables and Data Types.............................................................
1300:	   1.2.1 - Identify the most appropriate data type category for a particular specification. 
1301:	      1.2.1.1 - A data type is a set of values and a corresponding set of operations 
1302:	                 on those values. Data types can be categorized as either primitive or reference. 
1303:	      1.2.1.2 - The primitive data types used in this course define the set of values 
1304:	                 and corresponding operations on those values for numbers and Boolean values. 
1305:	      1.2.1.3 - A reference type is used to define objects that are not primitive 
1306:	                 types.
1307:	   1.2.2 - Develop code to declare variables to store numbers and Boolean values.
1308:	      1.2.2.1 - The three primitive data types used in this course are int, double, 
1309:	                 and boolean. An int value is an integer. A double value is a real number. 
1310:	                 A boolean value is either true or false. Note: the other five primitive data 
1311:	                 types (long, short, byte, float, and char) are outside the scope of the AP 
1312:	                 Computer Science A course and exam. 
1313:	      1.2.2.2 - A variable is a storage location that holds a value, which can change 
1314:	                 while the program is running. Every variable has a name and an associated 
1315:	                 data type. A variable of a primitive type holds a primitive value from that 
1316:	                 type.
1317:	1.3 - Expressions and Output...............................................................
1318:	   1.3.1 - Develop code to generate output and determine the result that would be 
1319:	              displayed.
1320:	      1.3.1.1 - System.out.print and System.out.println display information on the 
1321:	                 computer display. System.out.println moves the cursor to a new line after 
1322:	                 the information has been displayed, while System.out.print does not.
1323:	   1.3.2 - Develop code to utilize string literals and determine the result of using 
1324:	              string literals.
1325:	      1.3.2.1 - A literal is the code  representation of a fixed value. 
1326:	      1.3.2.2 - A string literal is a sequence of characters enclosed in double 
1327:	                 quotes. 
1328:	      1.3.2.3 - Escape sequences are special sequences of characters that can be 
1329:	                 included in a string. They start with a \ and have a special meaning in Java. 
1330:	                 Escape sequences used in this course include double quote \", backslash \\, 
1331:	                 and newline \n.
1332:	   1.3.3 - Develop code for arithmetic expressions and determine the result of these 
1333:	              expressions. 
1334:	      1.3.3.1 - Arithmetic expressions, which consist of numeric values, variables, 
1335:	                 and operators, include expressions of type int and double. 
1336:	      1.3.3.2 - The arithmetic operators consist of addition +, subtraction -, multiplication 
1337:	                 *, division /, and remainder %. An  arithmetic operation that uses two int 
1338:	                 values will evaluate to an int value. An arithmetic operation that uses at 
1339:	                 least one double value will evaluate to a double value. Note: Expressions 
1340:	                 that result in special double values (e.g., infinities and NaN) are outside 
1341:	                 the scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam.
1342:	      1.3.3.3 - When dividing numeric values that are both int values, the result 
1343:	                 is only the integer portion of the quotient. When dividing numeric values 
1344:	                 that use at least one double value, the result is the quotient. 
1345:	      1.3.3.4 - The remainder operator % is used to compute the remainder when one 
1346:	                 number a is divided by another number b. Note: The use of values less than 
1347:	                 0 for a and the use of values less than or equal to 0 for b is outside the 
1348:	                 scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam. 
1349:	      1.3.3.5 - Operators can be used to construct compound expressions. At compile 
1350:	                 time, numeric values are associated with operators according to operator precedence 
1351:	                 to determine how they are grouped. Parentheses can be used to modify operator 
1352:	                 precedence. Multiplication, division, and remainder have precedence over addition 
1353:	                 and subtraction. Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left 
1354:	                 to right. 
1355:	      1.3.3.6 - An attempt to divide an integer by the integer zero will result 
1356:	                 in an ArithmeticException. Note: The use of dividing by zero when one numeric 
1357:	                 value is a double is outside the scope of the AP Computer Science A course 
1358:	                 and exam)
1359:	1.4 - Assignment Statements and Input......................................................
1360:	   1.4.1 - Develop code for assignment statements with expressions and determine 
1361:	              the value that is stored in the variable as a result of these statements. 
1362:	      1.4.1.1 - Every variable must be assigned a value before it can be used in 
1363:	                 an expression. That value must be from a compatible data type. A variable 
1364:	                 is initialized the first time it is assigned a value. Reference types can 
1365:	                 be assigned a new object or null if there is no object. The literal null is 
1366:	                 a special value used to indicate that a reference is not associated with any 
1367:	                 object. 
1368:	      1.4.1.2 - The assignment operator = allows a program to initialize or change 
1369:	                 the value stored in a variable. The value of the expression on the right is 
1370:	                 stored in the variable on the left. Note: The use of assignment operators 
1371:	                 inside expressions (e.g., a = b = 4; or a[i += 5]) is outside the scope of 
1372:	                 the AP Computer Science A course and exam.
1373:	      1.4.1.3 - During execution, an expression is evaluated to produce a single 
1374:	                 value. The value of an expression has a type based on the evaluation of the 
1375:	                 expression)
1376:	   1.4.2 - Develop code to read input.
1377:	      1.4.2.1 - Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, 
1378:	                 or text. The Scanner class is one way to obtain text input from the keyboard. 
1379:	                 Note: Any specific form of input from the user is outside the scope of the 
1380:	                 AP Computer Science A course and exam.
1381:	1.5 - Casting and Range of Variables.......................................................
1382:	   1.5.1 - Develop code to cast primitive values to different primitive types in 
1383:	              arithmetic expressions and determine the value that is produced as a result.
1384:	      1.5.1.1 - The casting operators (int) and (double) can be used to convert 
1385:	                 from a double value to an int value (or vice versa). 
1386:	      1.5.1.2 - Casting a double value to an int value causes the digits to the 
1387:	                 right of the decimal point to be truncated. 
1388:	      1.5.1.3 - Some code causes int values to be automatically cast (widened) to 
1389:	                 double values. 
1390:	      1.5.1.4 - Values of type double can be rounded to the nearest integer by (int) 
1391:	                 (x + 0.5) for non-negative numbers or (int)(x - 0.5) for negative numbers.
1392:	   1.5.2 - Describe conditions when an integer expression evaluates to a value out 
1393:	              of range.
1394:	      1.5.2.1 - The constant Integer.MAX_VALUE holds the value of the largest possible 
1395:	                 int value. The constant Integer.MIN_VALUE holds the value of the smallest 
1396:	                 possible int value. 
1397:	      1.5.2.2 - Integer values in Java are represented by values of type int, which 
1398:	                 are stored using a finite amount (4 bytes) of memory. Therefore, an int value 
1399:	                 must be in the range from Integer.MIN_VALUE to Integer.MAX_VALUE inclusive.
1400:	      1.5.2.3 - If an expression would evaluate to an int value outside of the allowed 
1401:	                 range, an integer overflow occurs. The result is an int value in the allowed 
1402:	                 range but not necessarily the value expected.
1403:	   1.5.3 - Describe conditions that limit accuracy of expressions.
1404:	      1.5.3.1 - Computers allot a specified amount of memory to store data based 
1405:	                 on the data type. If an expression would evaluate to a double that is more 
1406:	                 precise than can be stored in the allotted amount of memory, a round-off error 
1407:	                 occurs. The result will be rounded to the representable value. To avoid rounding 
1408:	                 errors that naturally occur, use int values. Note: Other special decimal data 
1409:	                 types that can be used to avoid rounding errors are outside the scope of the 
1410:	                 AP Computer Science A course and exam.
1411:	1.6 - Compound Assignment Operators........................................................
1412:	   1.6.1 - Develop code for assignment statements with compound assignment operators 
1413:	              and determine the value that is stored in the variable as a result.
1414:	      1.6.1.1 - Compound assignment operators +=, −=, *=, /=, and %= can be used 
1415:	                 in place of the assignment operator in numeric expressions. A compound assignment 
1416:	                 operator performs the indicated arithmetic operation between  the value on 
1417:	                 the left and the value on the right and then assigns the result to the variable 
1418:	                 on the left. 
1419:	      1.6.1.2 - The post-increment operator ++ and postdecrement operator -- are 
1420:	                 used to add 1 or subtract 1 from the stored value of a numeric variable. The 
1421:	                 new value is assigned to the variable. Note: The use of increment and decrement 
1422:	                 operators in prefix form (e.g., ++x) is outside the scope of the AP Computer 
1423:	                 Science A course and exam. The use of increment and decrement operators inside 
1424:	                 other expressions (e.g., arr[x++]) is outside the scope of the AP Computer 
1425:	                 Science A course and exam.
1426:	1.7 - Application Program Interface (API) and Libraries....................................
1427:	   1.7.1 - Identify the attributes and behaviors of a class found in the libraries 
1428:	              contained in an API.
1429:	      1.7.1.1 - Libraries are collections of classes. An application programming 
1430:	                 interface (API) specification informs the programmer how to use those classes. 
1431:	                 Documentation found in API specifications and libraries is  essential to understanding 
1432:	                 the attributes and behaviors of a class defined by the API. A class defines 
1433:	                 a specific reference type. Classes in the APIs and libraries are grouped into 
1434:	                 packages. Existing classes and class libraries can be utilized to create objects. 
1435:	      1.7.1.2 - Attributes refer to the data related to the class and are stored 
1436:	                 in variables. Behaviors refer to what instances of the class can do (or what 
1437:	                 can be done with them) and are defined by methods.
1438:	1.8 - Documentation with Comments..........................................................
1439:	   1.8.1 - Describe the functionality and use of code through comments.
1440:	      1.8.1.1 - Comments are written for both the original programmer and other 
1441:	                 programmers to understand the code and its functionality, but are ignored 
1442:	                 by the compiler and are not executed when the program is run. Three types 
1443:	                 of comments in Java include /* */, which generates a block of comments; //, 
1444:	                 which generates a comment on one line; and /** */, which are Javadoc comments 
1445:	                 and are used to create API documentation. 
1446:	      1.8.1.2 - A precondition is a condition that must be true just prior to the 
1447:	                 execution of a method in order for it to behave as expected. There is no expectation 
1448:	                 that the method will check to ensure preconditions are satisfied. 
1449:	      1.8.1.3 - A postcondition is a condition that must always be true after the 
1450:	                 execution of a method. Postconditions describe the outcome of the execution 
1451:	                 in terms of what is being returned or the current value of the attributes 
1452:	                 of an object)
1453:	1.9 - Method Signatures....................................................................
1454:	   1.9.1 - Identify the correct method to call based on documentation and method 
1455:	              signatures.
1456:	      1.9.1.1 - A method is a named block of code that only runs when it is called. 
1457:	                 A block of code is any section of code that is enclosed in braces. Procedural 
1458:	                 abstraction allows a programmer to use a method by knowing what the method 
1459:	                 does even if they do not know how the method was written. 
1460:	      1.9.1.2 - A parameter is a variable declared in the header of a method or 
1461:	                 constructor and can be used inside the body of the method. This allows values 
1462:	                 or arguments to be passed and used by a method or constructor. A method signature 
1463:	                 for a method with parameters consists of the method name and the ordered list 
1464:	                 of parameter types. A method signature for a method without parameters consists 
1465:	                 of the method name and an empty parameter list)
1466:	   1.9.2 - Describe how to call methods.
1467:	      1.9.2.1 - A void method does not have a return value and is therefore not 
1468:	                 called as part of an expression. 
1469:	      1.9.2.2 - A non-void method returns a value that is the same type as the return 
1470:	                 type in the header. To use the return value when calling a non-void method, 
1471:	                 it must be stored in a variable or used as part of an expression. 
1472:	      1.9.2.3 - An argument is a value that is passed into a method when the method 
1473:	                 is called. The arguments passed to a method must be compatible in number and 
1474:	                 order with the types identified in the parameter list of the method signature. 
1475:	                 When calling methods, arguments are passed using call by value. Call by value 
1476:	                 initializes the parameters with copies of the arguments. 
1477:	      1.9.2.4 - Methods are said to be overloaded when there are multiple methods 
1478:	                 with the same name but different signatures. 
1479:	      1.9.2.5 - A method call interrupts the sequential execution of statements, 
1480:	                 causing the program to first execute the statements in the method before continuing. 
1481:	                 Once the last statement in the method has been executed or a return statement 
1482:	                 is executed, the flow of control is returned to the point immediately following 
1483:	                 where the method was called)
1484:	1.10 - Calling Class Methods...............................................................
1485:	   1.10.1 - Develop code to call class methods and determine the result of those 
1486:	              calls.
1487:	      1.10.1.1 - Class methods are associated with the class, not instances of the 
1488:	                 class. Class methods include the keyword static in the header before the method 
1489:	                 name. 
1490:	      1.10.1.2 - Class methods are typically called using the class name along with 
1491:	                 the dot operator. When the method call occurs in the defining class, the use 
1492:	                 of the class name is optional in the call)
1493:	1.11 - Math Class..........................................................................
1494:	   1.11.1 - Develop code to write expressions that incorporate calls to built-in 
1495:	              mathematical libraries and determine the value that is produced as a result.
1496:	      1.11.1.1 - The Math class is part of the java.lang package. Classes in the 
1497:	                 java.lang package are available by default. 
1498:	      1.11.1.2 - The Math class contains only class methods. The following Math 
1499:	                 class methods - including what they do and when they are used - are part of 
1500:	                 the Java Quick Reference: (a) static int abs(int x) returns the absolute value 
1501:	                 of an int value. (b) static double abs(double x) returns the absolute value 
1502:	                 of a double value. (c) static double pow(double base, double exponent) returns 
1503:	                 the value of the first parameter raised to the power of the second parameter. 
1504:	                 (d) static double sqrt(double x) returns the nonnegative square root of a 
1505:	                 double value. (e) static double random() returns a double value greater than 
1506:	                 or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0. 
1507:	      1.11.1.3 - The values returned from Math.random() can be manipulated using 
1508:	                 arithmetic and casting operators toproduce a random int or double in a defined 
1509:	                 range based on specified criteria. Each endpoint of the range can be inclusive, 
1510:	                 meaning the value is included, or exclusive, meaning the value is not included.
1511:	1.12 - Objects: Instances of Classes.......................................................
1512:	   1.12.1 - Explain the relationship between a class and an object.
1513:	      1.12.1.1 - An object is a specific instance of a class with defined attributes. 
1514:	                 A class is the formal implementation, or blueprint, of the attributes and 
1515:	                 behaviors of an object.
1516:	      1.12.1.2 - A class hierarchy can be developed by putting common attributes 
1517:	                 and behaviors of related classes into a single class called a superclass. 
1518:	                 Classes that extend a superclass, called subclasses, can draw upon the existing 
1519:	                 attributes and behaviors of the superclass without replacing these in the 
1520:	                 code. This creates an inheritance relationship from the subclasses to the 
1521:	                 superclass. Note: Designing and implementing inheritance relationships are 
1522:	                 outside the scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam.
1523:	      1.12.1.3 - All classes in Java are subclasses of the Object class.
1524:	   1.12.2 - Develop code to declare variables to store reference types.
1525:	      1.12.2.1 - A variable of a reference type holds an object reference, which 
1526:	                 can be thought of as the memory address of that object.
1527:	1.13 - Object Creation and Storage (Instantiation).........................................
1528:	   1.13.1 - Identify, using its signature, the correct constructor being called.
1529:	      1.13.1.1 - A class contains constructors that are called to create objects. 
1530:	                 They have the same name as the class.
1531:	      1.13.1.2 - A constructor signature consists of the constructor's name, which 
1532:	                 is the same as the class name, and the ordered list of parameter types. The 
1533:	                 parameter list, in the header of a constructor, lists the types of the values 
1534:	                 that are passed and their variable names.
1535:	      1.13.1.3 - Constructors are said to be overloaded when there are multiple 
1536:	                 constructors with different signatures.
1537:	   1.13.2 - Develop code to declare variables of the correct types to hold object 
1538:	              references.
1539:	      1.13.2.1 - A variable of a reference type holds an object reference or, if 
1540:	                 there is no object, null
1541:	   1.13.3 - Develop code to create an object by calling a constructor.
1542:	      1.13.3.1 - An object is typically created using the keyword new followed by 
1543:	                 a call to one of the class's constructors.
1544:	      1.13.3.2 - Parameters allow constructors to accept values to establish the 
1545:	                 initial values of the attributes of the object.
1546:	      1.13.3.3 - A constructor argument is a value that is passed into a constructor 
1547:	                 when the constructor is called. The arguments passed to a constructor must 
1548:	                 be compatible in order and number with the types identified in the parameter 
1549:	                 list in the constructor signature. When calling constructors, arguments are 
1550:	                 passed using call by value. Call by value initializes the parameters with 
1551:	                 copies of the arguments.
1552:	      1.13.3.4 - A constructor call interrupts the sequential execution of statements, 
1553:	                 causing the program to first execute the statements in the constructor before 
1554:	                 continuing. Once the last statement in the constructor has been executed, 
1555:	                 the flow of control is returned to the point immediately following where the 
1556:	                 constructor was called.
1557:	1.14 - Calling Instance Methods............................................................
1558:	   1.14.1 - Develop code to call instance methods and determine the result of these 
1559:	              calls.
1560:	      1.14.1.1 - Instance methods are called on objects of the class. The dot operator 
1561:	                 is used along with the object name to call instance methods.
1562:	      1.14.1.2 - A method call on a null reference will result in a NullPointerException.
1563:	1.15 - String Manipulation.................................................................
1564:	   1.15.1 - Develop code to create string objects and determine the result of creating 
1565:	              and combining strings. 
1566:	      1.15.1.1 - A String object represents a sequence of characters and can be 
1567:	                 created by using a string literal or by calling the String class constructor.
1568:	      1.15.1.2 - The String class is part of the java.lang package. Classes in the 
1569:	                 java.lang package are available by default. 
1570:	      1.15.1.3 - A String object is immutable, meaning once a String object is created, 
1571:	                 its attributes cannot be changed. Methods called on a String object do not 
1572:	                 change the content of the String object.
1573:	      1.15.1.4 - Two String objects can be concatenated together or combined using 
1574:	                 the + or += operator, resulting in a new String object. A primitive value 
1575:	                 can be concatenated with a String object. This causes the implicit conversion 
1576:	                 of the primitive value to a String object.
1577:	      1.15.1.5 - A String object can be concatenated with any object, which implicitly 
1578:	                 calls the object's toString method (a behavior that is guaranteed to exist 
1579:	                 by the inheritance relationship every class has with the Object class). An 
1580:	                 object's toString method returns a string value representing the object. Subclasses 
1581:	                 of Object often override the toString method with class specific implementation. 
1582:	                 Method overriding occurs when a public method in a subclass has the same method 
1583:	                 signature as a public method in the superclass, but the behavior of the method 
1584:	                 is specific to the subclass. Note: Overriding the toString method of a class 
1585:	                 is outside the scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam.
1586:	   1.15.2 - Develop code to call methods on string objects and determine the result 
1587:	              of calling these methods.
1588:	      1.15.2.1 - A String object has index values from 0 to one less than the length 
1589:	                 of the string. Attempting to access indices outside this range will result 
1590:	                 in an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
1591:	      1.15.2.2 - The following String methods - including what they do and when 
1592:	                 they are used - are part of the Java Quick Reference: (a)  int length() returns 
1593:	                 the number of characters in a String object. (b) String substring(int from, 
1594:	                 int to) returns the substring beginning at index from and ending at index 
1595:	                 to - 1. (c) String substring(int from) returns substring(from, length()). 
1596:	                 (d) int indexOf(String str) returns the index of the first occurrence of str; 
1597:	                 returns -1 if not found. (e) boolean equals(Object other) returns true if 
1598:	                 this corresponds to the same sequence of characters as other; returns false 
1599:	                 otherwise. (f) int compareTo(String other) returns a value < 0 if this is 
1600:	                 less than other; returns zero if this is equal to other; returns a value > 
1601:	                 0 if this is greater than other. Strings are ordered based upon the alphabet. 
1602:	                 Note: Using the equals method to compare one String object with an object 
1603:	                 of a type other than String is outside the scope of the AP Computer Science 
1604:	                 A course and exam1.15.2.3 - A string identical to the single element substring 
1605:	                 at position index can be created by calling substring(index, index + 1).

1607:	Unit 2 - Selection and Iteration...........................................................
1608:	2.1 - Algorithms with Selection and Repetition.............................................
1609:	   2.1.1 - Represent patterns and algorithms that involve selection and repetition 
1610:	              found in everyday life using written language or diagrams.
1611:	      2.1.1.1 - The building blocks of algorithms include sequencing, selection, 
1612:	                 and repetition. 
1613:	      2.1.1.2 - Algorithms can contain selection, through decision making, and repetition, 
1614:	                 via looping.
1615:	      2.1.1.3 - Selection occurs when a choice of how the execution of an algorithm 
1616:	                 will proceed is based on a true or false decision.
1617:	      2.1.1.4 - Repetition is when a process repeats itself until a desired outcome 
1618:	                 is reached.
1619:	      2.1.1.5 - The order in which sequencing, selection, and repetition are used 
1620:	                 contributes to the outcome of the algorithm.
1621:	2.2 - Boolean Expressions..................................................................
1622:	   2.2.1 - Develop code to create Boolean expressions with relational operators 
1623:	              and determine the result of these expressions.
1624:	      2.2.1.1 - Values can be compared using the relational operators == and != 
1625:	                 to determine whether the values are the same. With primitive types, this compares 
1626:	                 the actual primitive values. With reference types, this compares the object 
1627:	                 references.
1628:	      2.2.1.2 - Numeric values can be compared using the relational operators <, 
1629:	                 >, <=, and >= to determine the relationship between the values.
1630:	      2.2.1.3 - An expression involving relational operators evaluates to a Boolean 
1631:	                 value.
1632:	2.3 - if Statements........................................................................
1633:	   2.3.1 - Develop code to represent branching logical processes by using selection 
1634:	              statements and determine the result of these processes.
1635:	      2.3.1.1 - Selection statements change the sequential execution of statements.
1636:	      2.3.1.2 - An if statement is a type of selection statement that affects the 
1637:	                 flow of control by executing different segments of code based on the value 
1638:	                 of a Boolean expression.
1639:	      2.3.1.3 - A one-way selection (if statement) is used when there is a segment 
1640:	                 of code to execute under a certain condition. In this case, the body is executed 
1641:	                 only when the Boolean expression is true.
1642:	      2.3.1.4 - A two-way selection (if-else statement) is used when there are two 
1643:	                 segments of code - one to be executed when the Boolean expression is true 
1644:	                 and another segment for when the Boolean expression is false. In this case, 
1645:	                 the body of the if is executed when the Boolean expression is true, and the 
1646:	                 body of the else is executed when the Boolean expression is false.
1647:	2.4 - Nested if Statements.................................................................
1648:	   2.4.1 - Develop code to represent nested branching logical processes and determine 
1649:	              the result of these processes.
1650:	      2.4.1.1 - Nested if statements consist of if, if-else, or if-else-if statements 
1651:	                 within if, if-else, or if-else-if statements.
1652:	      2.4.1.2 - The Boolean expression of the inner nested if statement is evaluated 
1653:	                 only if the Boolean expression of the outer if statement evaluates to true.
1654:	      2.4.1.3 - A multiway selection (if-else-if) is used when there are a series 
1655:	                 of expressions with different segments of code for each condition. Multiway 
1656:	                 selection is performed such that no more than one segment of code is executed 
1657:	                 based on the first expression that evaluates to true. If no expression evaluates 
1658:	                 to true and there is a trailing else statement, then the body of the else 
1659:	                 is executed.
1660:	2.5 - Compound Boolean Expressions.........................................................
1661:	   2.5.1 - Develop code to represent compound Boolean expressions and determine 
1662:	              the result of these expressions.
1663:	      2.5.1.1 - Logical operators ! (not), && (and), and || (or) are used with Boolean 
1664:	                 expressions. The expression !a evaluates to true if a is false and evaluates 
1665:	                 to false otherwise. The expression a && b evaluates to true if both a and 
1666:	                 b are true and evaluates to false otherwise. The expression a || b evaluates 
1667:	                 to true if a is true, b is true, or both, and evaluates to false otherwise. 
1668:	                 The order of precedence for evaluating logical operators is ! (not), && (and), 
1669:	                 then || (or). An expression involving logical operators evaluates to a Boolean 
1670:	                 value. 
1671:	      2.5.1.2 - Short-circuit evaluation occurs when the result of a logical operation 
1672:	                 using && or || can be determined by evaluating only the first Boolean expression. 
1673:	                 In this case, the second Boolean expression is not evaluated.
1674:	2.6 - Comparing Boolean Expressions........................................................
1675:	   2.6.1 - Compare equivalent Boolean expressions.
1676:	      2.6.1.1 - Two Boolean expressions are equivalent if they evaluate to the same 
1677:	                 value in all cases. Truth tables can be used to prove Boolean expressions 
1678:	                 are equivalent.
1679:	      2.6.1.2 - De Morgan's law can be applied to Boolean expressions to create 
1680:	                 equivalent Boolean expressions. Under De Morgan's law, the Boolean expression 
1681:	                 !(a && b) is equivalent to !a || !b and the Boolean expression !(a || b) is 
1682:	                 equivalent to !a && !b. 
1683:	   2.6.2 - Develop code to compare object references using Boolean expressions and 
1684:	              determine the result of these expressions.
1685:	      2.6.2.1 - Two different variables can hold references to the same object. 
1686:	                 Object references can be compared using == and !=. 
1687:	      2.6.2.2 - An object reference can be compared with null, using == or !=, to 
1688:	                 determine if the reference actually references an object. 
1689:	      2.6.2.3 - Classes often define their own equals method, which can be used 
1690:	                 to specify the criteria for equivalency for two objects of the class. The 
1691:	                 equivalency of two objects is most often determined using attributes from 
1692:	                 the two objects. Note: Overriding the equals method is outside the scope of 
1693:	                 the AP Computer Science A course and exam.
1694:	2.7 - while Loops..........................................................................
1695:	   2.7.1 - Identify when an iterative process is required to achieve a desired result.
1696:	      2.7.1.1 - Iteration is a form of repetition. Iteration statements change the 
1697:	                 flow of control by repeating a segment of code zero or more times as long 
1698:	                 as the Boolean expression controlling the loop evaluates to true. 
1699:	      2.7.1.2 - An infinite loop occurs when the Boolean expression in an iterative 
1700:	                 statement always evaluates to true.
1701:	      2.7.1.3 - The loop body of an iterative statement will not execute if the 
1702:	                 Boolean expression initially evaluates to false.
1703:	      2.7.1.4 - Off by one errors occur when the iteration statement loops one time 
1704:	                 too many or one time too few.
1705:	   2.7.2 - Develop code to represent iterative processes using while loops and determine 
1706:	              the result of these processes.
1707:	      2.7.2.1 - A while loop is a type of iterative statement. In while loops, the 
1708:	                 Boolean expression is evaluated before each iteration of the loop body, including 
1709:	                 the first. When the expression evaluates to true, the loop body is executed. 
1710:	                 This continues until the Boolean expression evaluates to false, whereupon 
1711:	                 the iteration terminates.
1712:	2.8 - for Loops............................................................................
1713:	   2.8.1 - Develop code to represent iterative processes using for loops and determine 
1714:	              the result of these processes.
1715:	      2.8.1.1 - A for loop is a type of iterative statement. There are three parts 
1716:	                 in a for loop header: the initialization, the Boolean expression, and the 
1717:	                 update.
1718:	      2.8.1.2 - In a for loop, the initialization statement is only executed once 
1719:	                 before the first Boolean expression evaluation. The variable being initialized 
1720:	                 is referred to as a loop control variable. The Boolean expression is evaluated 
1721:	                 immediately after the loop control variable is initialized and then following 
1722:	                 each execution of the increment statement until it is false. In each iteration, 
1723:	                 the update is executed after the entire loop body is executed and before the 
1724:	                 Boolean expression is evaluated again.
1725:	      2.8.1.3 - A for loop can be rewritten into an equivalent while loop (and vice 
1726:	                 versa).
1727:	2.9 - Implementing Selection and Iteration Algorithms......................................
1728:	   2.9.1 - Develop code for standard and original algorithms (without data structures) 
1729:	              and determine the result of these algorithms.
1730:	      2.9.1.1 - There are standard algorithms to: (a) identify if an integer is 
1731:	                 or is not evenly divisible by another integer (b)  identify the individual 
1732:	                 digits in an integer, (c) determine the frequency with which a specific criterion 
1733:	                 is met (d) determine a minimum or maximum value, and (e) compute a sum or 
1734:	                 average
1735:	2.10 - Implementing String Algorithms......................................................
1736:	   2.10.1 - Develop code for standard and original algorithms that involve strings 
1737:	              and determine the result of these algorithms. 
1738:	      2.10.1.1 - There are standard string algorithms to: (a) find if one or more 
1739:	                 substrings have a particular property, (b)  determine the number of substrings 
1740:	                 that meet specific criteria, (c) create a new string with the characters reversed
1741:	2.11 - Nested Iteration....................................................................
1742:	   2.11.1 - Develop code to represent nested iterative processes and determine the 
1743:	              result of these processes.
1744:	      2.11.1.1 - Nested iteration statements are iteration statements that appear 
1745:	                 in the body of another iteration statement. When a loop is nested inside another 
1746:	                 loop, the inner loop must complete all its iterations before the outer loop 
1747:	                 can continue to its next iteration.
1748:	2.12 - Informal Run-Time Analysis..........................................................
1749:	   2.12.1 - Calculate statement execution counts and informal run-time comparison 
1750:	              of iterative statements.
1751:	      2.12.1.1 - A statement execution count indicates the number of times a statement 
1752:	                 is executed by the program. Statement execution counts are often calculated 
1753:	                 informally through tracing and analysis of the iterative statements.

1755:	Unit 3 - Class Creation....................................................................
1756:	3.1 - Abstraction and Program Design.......................................................
1757:	   3.1.1 - Represent the design of a program by using natural language or creating 
1758:	              diagrams that indicate the classes in the program and the data and procedural 
1759:	              abstractions found in each class by including all attributes and behaviors. 
1760:	      3.1.1.1 - Abstraction is the process of reducing complexity by focusing on 
1761:	                 the main idea. By hiding details irrelevant to the question at hand and bringing 
1762:	                 together related and useful details, abstraction reduces complexity and allows 
1763:	                 one to focus on the idea.
1764:	      3.1.1.2 - Data abstraction provides a separation between the abstract properties 
1765:	                 of a data type and the concrete details of its  representation. Data abstraction 
1766:	                 manages complexity by giving data a name without referencing the specific 
1767:	                 details of the representation.  Data can take the form of a single variable 
1768:	                 or a collection of data, such as in a class or a set of data.
1769:	      3.1.1.3 - An attribute is a type of data abstraction that is defined in a 
1770:	                 class outside any method or constructor. An instance variable is an attribute 
1771:	                 whose value is unique to each instance of the class. A class variable is an 
1772:	                 attribute shared by all instances of the class.
1773:	      3.1.1.4 - Procedural abstraction provides a name for a process and allows 
1774:	                 a method to be used only knowing what it does, not how it does it. Through 
1775:	                 method decomposition, a programmer breaks down larger behaviors of the class 
1776:	                 into smaller behaviors by creating methods to represent each individual smaller 
1777:	                 behavior. A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize 
1778:	                 functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for code reuse, which 
1779:	                 helps manage complexity 
1780:	      3.1.1.5 - Using parameters allows procedures to be generalized, enabling the 
1781:	                 procedures to be reused with a range of input values or arguments.
1782:	      3.1.1.6 - Using procedural abstraction in a program allows programmers to 
1783:	                 change the internals of a method (to make it faster, more  efficient, use 
1784:	                 less storage, etc.) without needing to notify method users of the change as 
1785:	                 long as the method signature and what the  method does is preserved.
1786:	      3.1.1.7 - Prior to implementing a class, it is helpful to take time to design 
1787:	                 each class including its attributes and behaviors. This design can be represented 
1788:	                 using natural language or diagrams.
1789:	3.2 - Impact of Program Design.............................................................
1790:	   3.2.1 - Explain the social and ethical implications of computing systems.
1791:	      3.2.1.1 - System reliability refers to the program being able to perform its 
1792:	                 tasks as expected under stated conditions without failure. Programmers should 
1793:	                 make an effort to maximize system reliability by testing the program with 
1794:	                 a variety of conditions.
1795:	      3.2.1.2 - The creation of programs has impacts on society, the economy, and 
1796:	                 culture. These impacts can be both beneficial and harmful. Programs meant 
1797:	                 to fill a need or solve a problem can have unintended harmful effects beyond 
1798:	                 their intended use.
1799:	      3.2.1.3 - Legal issues and intellectual property concerns arise when creating 
1800:	                 programs. Programmers often reuse code written by others and published as 
1801:	                 open source and free to use. Incorporation of code that is not published as 
1802:	                 open source requires the programmer to obtain permission and often purchase 
1803:	                 the code before integrating it into their program.
1804:	3.3 - Anatomy of a Class...................................................................
1805:	   3.3.1 - Develop code to designate access and visibility constraints to classes, 
1806:	              data, constructors, and methods. 
1807:	      3.3.1.1 - Data encapsulation is a technique in which the implementation details 
1808:	                 of a class are kept hidden from external classes. The keywords public and 
1809:	                 private affect the access of classes, data, constructors, and methods. The 
1810:	                 keyword private restricts access to the declaring class, while the keyword 
1811:	                 public allows access from classes outside the declaring class.
1812:	      3.3.1.2 - In this course, classes are always designated public and are declared 
1813:	                 with the keyword class. 
1814:	      3.3.1.3 - In this course, constructors are always designated public.
1815:	      3.3.1.4 - Instance variables belong to the object, and each object has its 
1816:	                 own copy of the variable. 
1817:	      3.3.1.5 - Access to attributes should be kept internal to the class in order 
1818:	                 to accomplish encapsulation.  Therefore, it is good programming practice to 
1819:	                 designate the instance variables for these attributes as private unless the 
1820:	                 class specification states otherwise.
1821:	      3.3.1.6 - Access to behaviors can be internal or external to the class. Methods 
1822:	                 designated as public can be accessed internally or externally to a class, 
1823:	                 whereas methods designated as private can only be accessed internally to the 
1824:	                 class
1825:	3.4 - Constructors.........................................................................
1826:	   3.4.1 - Develop code to declare instance variables for the attributes to be initialized 
1827:	              in the body of the constructors of a class.
1828:	      3.4.1.1 - An object's state refers to its attributes and their values at a 
1829:	                 given time and is defined by instance variables belonging to the object. This 
1830:	                 defines a has-a relationship between the object and its instance variables. 
1831:	      3.4.1.2 - A constructor is used to set the initial state of an object, which 
1832:	                 should include initial values for all instance variables. When a constructor 
1833:	                  is called, memory is allocated for the object and the associated object reference 
1834:	                 is returned. Constructor parameters, if specified, provide data to  initialize 
1835:	                 instance variables.
1836:	      3.4.1.3 - When a mutable object is a constructor parameter, the instance variable 
1837:	                 should be initialized with a copy of the referenced object. In this way, the 
1838:	                 instance variable does not hold a reference to the original object, and methods 
1839:	                 are prevented from modifying the state of the original object.
1840:	      3.4.1.4 - When no constructor is written, Java provides a no-parameter constructor, 
1841:	                 and the instance variables are set to default values according to the data 
1842:	                 type of the attribute. This constructor is called the default constructor. 
1843:	      3.4.1.5 - The default value for an attribute of type int is 0. The default 
1844:	                 value of an attribute of type double is 0.0. The default value of an attribute 
1845:	                 of type boolean is false. The default value of a reference type is null.
1846:	3.5 - Methods: How to Write Them...........................................................
1847:	   3.5.1 - Develop code to define behaviors of an object through methods written 
1848:	              in a class using primitive values and determine the result of calling these methods.
1849:	      3.5.1.1 - A void method does not return a value. Its header contains the keyword 
1850:	                 void before the method name.
1851:	      3.5.1.2 - A non-void method returns a single value. Its header includes the 
1852:	                 return type in place of the keyword void.
1853:	      3.5.1.3 - In non-void methods, a return expression compatible with the return 
1854:	                 type is evaluated, and the value is returned. This is referred to as return 
1855:	                 by value.
1856:	      3.5.1.4 - The return keyword is used to return the flow of control to the 
1857:	                 point where the method or constructor was called. Any code that is sequentially 
1858:	                 after a return statement will never be executed. Executing a return statement 
1859:	                 inside a selection or iteration statement will halt the statement and exit 
1860:	                 the method or constructor.
1861:	      3.5.1.5 - An accessor method allows objects of other classes to obtain a copy 
1862:	                 of the value of instance variables or class variables. An accessor method 
1863:	                 is a non-void method. 
1864:	      3.5.1.6 - A mutator (modifier) method is a method that changes the values 
1865:	                 of the instance variables or class variables. A mutator method is often a 
1866:	                 void method.
1867:	      3.5.1.7 - Methods with parameters receive values through those parameters 
1868:	                 and use those values in accomplishing the method's task.
1869:	      3.5.1.8 - When an argument is a primitive value, the parameter is initialized 
1870:	                 with a copy of that value. Changes to the parameter have no effect on the 
1871:	                 corresponding argument.
1872:	3.6 - Methods: Passing and Returning References of an Object...............................
1873:	   3.6.1 - Develop code to define behaviors of an object through methods written 
1874:	              in a class using object references and determine the result of calling these 
1875:	              methods.
1876:	      3.6.1.1 - When an argument is an object reference, the parameter is initialized 
1877:	                 with a copy of that reference; it does not create a new independent copy of 
1878:	                 the object. If the parameter refers to a mutable object, the method or constructor 
1879:	                 can use this reference to alter the state of the object. It is good  programming 
1880:	                 practice to not modify mutable objects that are passed as parameters unless 
1881:	                 required in the specification.
1882:	      3.6.1.2 - When the return expression evaluates to an object reference, the 
1883:	                 reference is returned, not a reference to a new copy of the object. 
1884:	      3.6.1.3 - Methods cannot access the private data and  methods of a parameter 
1885:	                 that holds a reference to an object unless the parameter is the same type 
1886:	                 as the method's enclosing class
1887:	3.7 - Class Variables and Methods..........................................................
1888:	   3.7.1 - Develop code to define behaviors of a class through class methods.
1889:	      3.7.1.1 - Class methods cannot access or change the values of instance variables 
1890:	                 or call instance methods without being passed an instance of the class via 
1891:	                 a parameter.
1892:	      3.7.1.2 - Class methods can access or change the values of class variables 
1893:	                 and can call other class methods.
1894:	   3.7.2 - Develop code to declare the class variables that belong to the class.
1895:	      3.7.2.1 - Class variables belong to the class, with all objects of a class 
1896:	                 sharing a single copy of the class variable. Class variables are designated 
1897:	                 with the static keyword before the variable type.
1898:	      3.7.2.2 - Class variables that are designated public are accessed outside 
1899:	                 of the class by using the class name and the dot operator, since they are 
1900:	                 associated with a class, not objects of a class.
1901:	      3.7.2.3 - When a variable is declared final, its value cannot be modified.
1902:	3.8 - Scope and Access.....................................................................
1903:	   3.8.1 - Explain where variables can be used in the code.
1904:	      3.8.1.1 - Local variables are variables declared in the headers or bodies 
1905:	                 of blocks of code. Local variables can only be accessed in the block in which 
1906:	                 they are declared. Since constructors and methods are blocks of code, parameters 
1907:	                 to constructors or methods are also considered local variables. These variables 
1908:	                 may only be used within the constructor or method and cannot be declared to 
1909:	                 be public or private.
1910:	      3.8.1.2 - When there is a local variable or parameter with the same name as 
1911:	                 an instance variable, the variable name will refer to the local variable instead 
1912:	                 of the instance variable within the body of the constructor or method.
1913:	3.9 - this Keyword.........................................................................
1914:	   3.9.1 - Develop code for expressions that are self-referencing and determine 
1915:	              the result of these expressions.
1916:	      3.9.1.1 - Within an instance method or a constructor, the keyword this acts 
1917:	                 as a special variable that holds a reference to the current object - the object 
1918:	                 whose method or constructor is being called.
1919:	      3.9.1.2 - The keyword this can be used to pass the current object as an argument 
1920:	                 in a method call. 
1921:	      3.9.1.3 - Class methods do not have a this reference.
1922:	Computer Science 42SAP - AP curriculum - Unit 4: Data Collections content running simulated:.
1923:	Unit 4 - Data Collections..................................................................
1924:	4.1 - Ethical and Social Issues Around Data Collection.....................................
1925:	   4.1.1 - Explain the risks to privacy from collecting and storing personal data 
1926:	              on computer systems.
1927:	      4.1.1.1 - When using a computer, personal privacy is at risk. When developing 
1928:	                 new programs, programmers should attempt to safeguard the personal privacy 
1929:	                 of the user.
1930:	   4.1.2 - Explain the importance of recognizing data quality and potential issues 
1931:	              when using a data set.
1932:	      4.1.2.1 - Algorithmic bias describes systemic and repeated errors in a program 
1933:	                 that create unfair outcomes for a specific group of users.
1934:	      4.1.2.2 - Programmers should be aware of the data set collection method and 
1935:	                 the potential for bias when using this method before using  the data to extrapolate 
1936:	                 new information or drawing conclusions.
1937:	      4.1.2.3 - Some data sets are incomplete or contain inaccurate data. Using 
1938:	                 such data in the development or use of a program can cause the program to 
1939:	                 work incorrectly or inefficiently. 
1940:	   4.1.3 - Identify an appropriate data set to use in order to solve a problem or 
1941:	              answer a specific question.
1942:	      4.1.3.1 - Contents of a data set might be related to a specific question or 
1943:	                 topic and might not be appropriate to give correct answers or extrapolate 
1944:	                 information for a different question or topic.
1945:	4.2 - Introduction to Using Data Sets......................................................
1946:	   4.2.1 - Represent patterns and algorithms that involve data sets found in everyday 
1947:	              life using written language or diagrams.
1948:	      4.2.1.1 - A data set is a collection of specific pieces of information or 
1949:	                 data.
1950:	      4.2.1.2 - Data sets can be manipulated and analyzed to solve a problem or 
1951:	                 answer a question. When analyzing data sets, values within the set are accessed 
1952:	                 and utilized one at a time and then processed according to the desired outcome.
1953:	      4.2.1.3 - Data can be represented in a diagram by using a chart or table. 
1954:	                 This visual can be used to plan the algorithm that will be used to manipulate 
1955:	                 the data
1956:	4.3 - Array Creation and Access............................................................
1957:	   4.3.1 - Develop code used to represent collections of related data using one 
1958:	              dimensional (1D) array objects.
1959:	      4.3.1.1 - An array stores multiple values of the same type. The values can 
1960:	                 be either primitive values or object references. 
1961:	      4.3.1.2 - The length of an array is established at the time of creation and 
1962:	                 cannot be changed. The length of an array can be accessed through the length 
1963:	                 attribute.
1964:	      4.3.1.3 - When an array is created using the keyword new, all of its elements 
1965:	                 are initialized to the default values for the element data type. The  default 
1966:	                 value for int is 0, for double is 0.0, for boolean is false, and for a reference 
1967:	                 type is null. 
1968:	      4.3.1.4 - Initializer lists can be used to create and initialize arrays.
1969:	      4.3.1.5 - Square brackets [ ] are used to access and modify an element in 
1970:	                 a 1D array using an index. 
1971:	      4.3.1.6 - The valid index values for an array are 0 through one less than 
1972:	                 the length of the array, inclusive. Using an index value outside of this range 
1973:	                 will result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
1974:	4.4 - Array Traversals.....................................................................
1975:	   4.4.1 - Develop code used to traverse the elements in a 1D array and determine 
1976:	              the result of these traversals.
1977:	      4.4.1.1 - Traversing an array is when repetition statements are used to access 
1978:	                 all or an ordered sequence of elements in an array. 
1979:	      4.4.1.2 - Traversing an array with an indexed for loop or while loop requires 
1980:	                 elements to be accessed using their indices.
1981:	      4.4.1.3 - An enhanced for loop header includes a variable, referred to as 
1982:	                 the enhanced for loop variable. For each iteration of the enhanced for loop, 
1983:	                  the enhanced for loop variable is assigned a copy of an element without using 
1984:	                 its index. 
1985:	      4.4.1.4 - Assigning a new value to the enhanced for loop variable does not 
1986:	                 change the value stored in the array.
1987:	      4.4.1.5 - When an array stores object references, the attributes can be modified 
1988:	                 by calling methods on the enhanced for loop variable. This does not change 
1989:	                 the object references stored in the array.
1990:	      4.4.1.6 - Code written using an enhanced for loop to traverse elements in 
1991:	                 an array can be rewritten using an indexed for loop or a while loop.
1992:	4.5 - Implementing Array Algorithms........................................................
1993:	   4.5.1 - Develop code for standard and original algorithms for a particular context 
1994:	              or specification that involves arrays and determine the result of these algorithms. 
1995:	      4.5.1.1 - There are standard algorithms that utilize array traversals to: 
1996:	                 (a) determine a minimum or maximum value, (b) compute a sum or average, (d) 
1997:	                 determine if at least one element has a particular property, (e) determine 
1998:	                 if all elements have a particular property, (f) determine the number of elements 
1999:	                 having a particular property, (g) access all consecutive pairs of elements, 
2000:	                 (h) determine the presence or absence of duplicate elements, (i) shift or 
2001:	                 rotate elements left or right, (j) reverse the order of the elements
2002:	4.6 - Using Text Files.....................................................................
2003:	   4.6.1 - Develop code to read data from a text file.
2004:	      4.6.1.1 - A file is storage for data that persists when the program is not 
2005:	                 running. The data in a file can be retrieved during program execution.
2006:	      4.6.1.2 - A file can be connected to the program using the File and Scanner 
2007:	                 classes.
2008:	      4.6.1.3 - A file can be opened by creating a File object, using the name of 
2009:	                 the file as the argument of the constructor. File(String str) is the File 
2010:	                 constructor that accepts a String file name to open for reading, where str 
2011:	                 is the pathname for the file.
2012:	      4.6.1.4 - When using the File class, it is required to indicate what to do 
2013:	                 if the file with the provided name cannot be opened. One way to accomplish 
2014:	                 this is to add throws IOException to the header of the method that uses the 
2015:	                 file. If the file name is invalid, the program will terminate.
2016:	      4.6.1.5 - The File and IOException classes are part of the java.io package. 
2017:	                 An import statement must be used to make these classes available for use in 
2018:	                  the program
2019:	      4.6.1.6 - Scanner methods are part of Java Quick Reference: (a) Scanner(File 
2020:	                 f) is the Scanner constructor that accepts a File for reading. (b)int nextInt() 
2021:	                 returns the next int read from the file or input source if available. If the 
2022:	                 next int does not exist or is out of range, it will result in an InputMismatchException. 
2023:	                 (c) double nextDouble() returns the next  double read from the file or input 
2024:	                 source. If the next double does not exist, it will result in an InputMismatchException. 
2025:	                 (d) boolean nextBoolean() returns the next boolean read from the file or input 
2026:	                 source. If the next boolean does not exist, it will result in an InputMismatchException. 
2027:	                 (e) String nextLine() returns the next line of text as a String read from 
2028:	                 the file or input source; can return the empty string if called immediately 
2029:	                 after another Scanner method that is reading from the file or input source. 
2030:	                 (f) String next() returns the next String read from the file or input source. 
2031:	                 (g)  boolean hasNext() returns true if ehere is a next item to read in the 
2032:	                 file or input source; returns false otherwise. (h) void close() closes this 
2033:	                 scanner. Note: accepting input from the keyboard is outside the scope of the 
2034:	                 AP Computer Science A course and exam.
2035:	      4.6.1.7 - Using nextLine and the other Scanner methods together on the same 
2036:	                 input source sometimes requires code to adjust for the methods' different 
2037:	                 ways of handling whitespace. Note: Writing or analyzing code that uses both 
2038:	                 nextLine and other Scanner methods on the same input source is outside the 
2039:	                 scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam.
2040:	      4.6.1.8 - The following additional String method - including what it does 
2041:	                 and when it is used - is part of the Java Quick Reference: (a) String[] split(String 
2042:	                 del returns a String array where each element is a substring of this String, 
2043:	                 which has been split around matches of the given expression del. Note: The 
2044:	                 parameter del uses a format called a regular expression. Writing or analyzing 
2045:	                 code that uses any of the special properties of regular expressions (e.g., 
2046:	                 \\*, \\.) is outside the scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam. 
2047:	      4.6.1.9 - A while loop can be used to detect if the file still contains elements 
2048:	                 to read by using the hasNext method as the condition of the loop.
2049:	      4.6.1.10 - A file should be closed when the program is finished using it. 
2050:	                 The close method from Scanner is called to close the file.
2051:	4.7 - Wrapper Classes......................................................................
2052:	   4.7.1 - Develop code to use Integer and Double objects from their primitive counterparts 
2053:	              and determine the result of using these objects.
2054:	      4.7.1.1 - The Integer class and Double class are part of the java.lang package. 
2055:	                 An Integer object is immutable, meaning once an Integer object is created, 
2056:	                 its attributes cannot be changed. A Double object is immutable, meaning once 
2057:	                 a Double object is created, its attributes cannot be changed. 
2058:	      4.7.1.2 - Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes 
2059:	                 between primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes. This 
2060:	                 includes converting an int to an Integer and a double to a Double. The Java 
2061:	                 compiler applies autoboxing when a primitive value is: (a) passed as a parameter 
2062:	                 to a method that expects an object of the corresponding wrapper class (b) 
2063:	                 assigned to a variable of the corresponding wrapper class 
2064:	      4.7.1.3 - Unboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes 
2065:	                 from the wrapper class to the primitive type. This includes converting an 
2066:	                 Integer to an int and a Double to a double. The Java compiler applies unboxing 
2067:	                 when a wrapper class object is: (a) passed as a parameter to a method that 
2068:	                 expects a value of the corresponding primitive type (b) assigned to a variable 
2069:	                 of the corresponding primitive type 
2070:	      4.7.1.4 - The following class Integer method - including what it does and 
2071:	                 when it is used - is part of the Java Quick Reference: (a) static int parseInt(String 
2072:	                 s) returns the String argument as an int. 
2073:	      4.7.1.5 - The following class Double method - including what it does and when 
2074:	                 it is used - is part of the Java Quick Reference: (a) static double parseDouble(String 
2075:	                 s) returns the String argument as a double.
2076:	4.8 - ArrayList Methods....................................................................
2077:	   4.8.1 - Develop code for collections of related objects using ArrayList objects 
2078:	              and determine the result of calling methods on these objects. 
2079:	      4.8.1.1 - An ArrayList object is mutable in size and contains object references. 
2080:	      4.8.1.2 - The ArrayList constructor ArrayList() constructs an empty list. 
2081:	      4.8.1.3 - Java allows the generic type ArrayList<E>, where the type parameter 
2082:	                 E specifies the type of the elements. When ArrayList<E> is specified, the 
2083:	                 types of the reference parameters and return type when using the ArrayList 
2084:	                 methods are type E. ArrayList<E> is preferred over ArrayList. For example, 
2085:	                 ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(); allows the compiler to 
2086:	                 find errors that would otherwise be found at run-time.
2087:	      4.8.1.4 - The ArrayList class is part of the java.util package. An import 
2088:	                 statement must be used to make this class available for use in the program. 
2089:	      4.8.1.5 - The following ArrayList methods - including what they do and when 
2090:	                 they are used - are part of the Java Quick Reference: (a) int size() returns 
2091:	                 the number of elements in the list. (b) boolean add(E obj) appends obj to 
2092:	                 end of list; returns true. (c) void add(int index, E obj) inserts obj at position 
2093:	                 index (0 <= index <= size), moving elements at position index and higher to 
2094:	                 the right (adds 1 to their indices) and adds 1 to size. (d) E get(int index) 
2095:	                 returns the element at position index in the list. (e) E set(int index, E 
2096:	                 obj) replaces the element at position index with obj; returns the element 
2097:	                 formerly at position index. (f) E remove(int index) removes element from position 
2098:	                 index, moving elements at position index + 1 and higher to the left (subtracts 
2099:	                 1 from their indices) and subtracts 1 from size; returns the element formerly 
2100:	                 at position index.
2101:	      4.8.1.6 - The indices for an ArrayList start at 0 and end at the number of 
2102:	                 elements - 1
2103:	4.9 - ArrayList Traversals.................................................................
2104:	   4.9.1 - Develop code used to traverse the elements of an ArrayList and determine 
2105:	              the results of these traversals.
2106:	      4.9.1.1 - Traversing an ArrayList is when iteration or recursive statements 
2107:	                 are used to access all or an ordered sequence of the elements in an ArrayList.
2108:	      4.9.1.2 - Deleting elements during a traversal of an ArrayList requires the 
2109:	                 use of special techniques to avoid skipping elements. 
2110:	      4.9.1.3 - Attempting to access an index value outside of its range will result 
2111:	                 in an IndexOutOfBoundsException. 
2112:	      4.9.1.4 - Changing the size of an ArrayList while traversing it using an enhanced 
2113:	                 for loop can result in a ConcurrentModificationException. Therefore, when 
2114:	                 using an enhanced for loop to traverse an ArrayList, you should not add or 
2115:	                 remove elements.
2116:	4.10 - Implementing ArrayList Algorithms...................................................
2117:	   4.10.1 - Develop code for standard and original algorithms for a particular context 
2118:	              or specification that involve ArrayList objects and determine the result of these 
2119:	              algorithms.
2120:	      4.10.1.1 - There are standard ArrayList algorithms that utilize traversals 
2121:	                 to: (a) determine a minimum or maximum value (b) compute a sum or average 
2122:	                 (c) determine if at least one element has a particular property (d) determine 
2123:	                 if all elements have a particular property (e) determine the number of elements 
2124:	                 having a particular property (f) access all consecutive pairs of elements 
2125:	                 (g) determine the presence or absence of duplicate elements (h) shift or rotate 
2126:	                 elements left or right (i) reverse the order of the elements (j)  insert elements 
2127:	                 (k)  delete elements
2128:	      4.10.1.2 - Some algorithms require multiple String, array, or ArrayList objects 
2129:	                 to be traversed simultaneously.
2130:	4.11 - 2D Array Creation and Access........................................................
2131:	   4.11.1 - Develop code used to represent collections of related data using twodimensional 
2132:	              (2D) array objects.
2133:	      4.11.1.1 - A 2D array is stored as an array of arrays. Therefore, the way 
2134:	                 2D arrays are created and indexed is similar to 1D array objects. The size 
2135:	                 of a 2D array is established at the time of creation and cannot be changed. 
2136:	                 2D arrays can store either primitive data or object reference data. Note: 
2137:	                 Nonrectangular 2D array objects are outside the scope of the AP Computer Science 
2138:	                 A course and exam.
2139:	      4.11.1.2 - When a 2D array is created using the keyword new, all of its elements 
2140:	                 are initialized to the default values for the element data type. The default 
2141:	                 value for int is 0, for double is 0.0, for boolean is false, and for a reference 
2142:	                 type is null. 
2143:	      4.11.1.3 - The initializer list used to create and initialize a 2D array consists 
2144:	                 of initializer lists that represent 1D arrays; for example, int[][] arr2D 
2145:	                 = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} };.
2146:	      4.11.1.4 - The square brackets [row][col] are used to access and modify an 
2147:	                 element in a 2D array. For the purposes of the exam, when accessing the element 
2148:	                 at arr[first][second], the first index is used for rows, the second index 
2149:	                 is used for columns.
2150:	      4.11.1.5 - A single array that is a row of a 2D array can be accessed using 
2151:	                 the 2D array name and a single set of square brackets containing the row index. 
2152:	      4.11.1.6 - The number of rows contained in a 2D array can be accessed through 
2153:	                 the length attribute. The valid row index values for a 2D array are 0 through 
2154:	                 one less than the number of rows or the length of the array, inclusive. The 
2155:	                 number of columns contained in a 2D array can be accessed through the length 
2156:	                 attribute of one of the rows. The valid column index values for a 2D array 
2157:	                 are 0 through one less than the number of columns or the length of any given 
2158:	                 row of the array, inclusive. For example, given a 2D array named values, the 
2159:	                 number of rows is  values. length and the number of columns is values[0].length. 
2160:	                 Using an index value outside of these ranges will result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
2161:	4.12 - 2D Array Traversals.................................................................
2162:	   4.12.1 - Develop code used to traverse the elements in a 2D array and determine 
2163:	              the result of these traversals.
2164:	      4.12.1.1 - Nested iteration statements are used to traverse and access all 
2165:	                 or an ordered sequence of elements in a 2D array. Since 2D arrays are stored 
2166:	                 as arrays of arrays, the way 2D arrays are traversed using for loops and enhanced 
2167:	                 for loops is similar to 1D array objects. Nested iteration statements can 
2168:	                 be written to traverse the 2D array in row-major order, column-major order, 
2169:	                 or a uniquely defined order. Row-major order refers to an ordering of 2D array 
2170:	                 elements where traversal occurs across each row, whereas columnmajor order 
2171:	                  traversal occurs down each column.
2172:	      4.12.1.2 - The outer loop of a nested enhanced for loop used to traverse a 
2173:	                 2D array traverses the rows. Therefore, the enhanced for loop variable must 
2174:	                 be the type of each row, which is a 1D array. The inner loop traverses a single 
2175:	                 row. Therefore, the inner enhanced for loop variable must be the same type 
2176:	                 as the elements stored in the 1D array. Assigning a new value to  the enhanced 
2177:	                 for loop variable does not change the value stored in the array. 
2178:	4.13 - Implementing 2D Array Algorithms....................................................
2179:	   4.13.1 - Develop code for standard and original algorithms for a particular context 
2180:	              or specification that involves 2D arrays and determine the result of these algorithms.
2181:	      4.13.1.1 - There are standard algorithms that utilize 2D array traversals 
2182:	                 to: (a) determine a minimum or maximum value of all the elements or for a 
2183:	                 designated row, column, or other subsection (b) compute a sum or average of 
2184:	                 all the elements or for a designated row, column, or other subsection (c) 
2185:	                 determine if at least one element has a particular property in the entire 
2186:	                 2D array or for a designated row, column, or other subsection (d) determine 
2187:	                 if all elements of the 2D array or a designated row, column, or other subsection 
2188:	                 have a particular property (e) determine the number of elements in the 2D 
2189:	                 array or in a designated row, column, or other subsection having a particular 
2190:	                 property (f) access all consecutive pairs of elements (g) determine the presence 
2191:	                 or absence of duplicate elements in the 2D array or in a designated row, column, 
2192:	                 or other subsection (h) shift or rotate elements in a row left or right or 
2193:	                 in a column up or down (i) reverse the order of the elements in a row or column
2194:	4.14 - Searching Algorithms................................................................
2195:	   4.14.1 - Develop code used for linear search algorithms to search for specific 
2196:	              information in a collection and determine the results of executing a search.
2197:	      4.14.1.1 - Linear search algorithms are standard algorithms that check each 
2198:	                 element in order until the desired value is found or all elements in the array 
2199:	                 or ArrayList have been checked. Linear search algorithms can begin the search 
2200:	                 process from either end of the array or ArrayList.
2201:	      4.14.1.2 - When applying linear search algorithms to 2D arrays, each row must 
2202:	                 be accessed then linear search applied to each row of the 2D array.
2203:	4.15 - Sorting Algorithms..................................................................
2204:	   4.15.1 - Determine the result of executing each step of sorting algorithms to 
2205:	              sort the elements of a collection.
2206:	      4.15.1.1 - Selection sort and insertion sort are iterative sorting algorithms 
2207:	                 that can be used to sort elements in an array or ArrayList. 
2208:	      4.15.1.2 - Selection sort repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element 
2209:	                 from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it into its correct (and final) 
2210:	                 position in the sorted portion of the list.
2211:	      4.15.1.3 - Insertion sort inserts an element from the unsorted portion of 
2212:	                 a list into its correct (but not necessarily final) position in the sorted 
2213:	                 portion of the list by shifting elements of the sorted portion to make room 
2214:	                 for the new element.
2215:	4.16 - Recursion...........................................................................
2216:	   4.16.1 - Determine the result of calling recursive methods.
2217:	      4.16.1.1 - A recursive method is a method that calls itself. Recursive methods 
2218:	                 contain at least one base case, which halts the recursion, and at least one 
2219:	                 recursive call. Recursion is another form of repetition.
2220:	      4.16.1.2 - Each recursive call has its own set of local variables, including 
2221:	                 the parameters. Parameter values capture the progress of a recursive process, 
2222:	                 much like loop control variable values capture the progress of a loop. 
2223:	      4.16.1.3 - Any recursive solution can be replicated through the use of an 
2224:	                 iterative approach and vice versa. Note: Writing recursive code is outside 
2225:	                 the scope of the  AP Computer Science A course and exam.
2226:	4.17 - Recursive Searching and Sorting.....................................................
2227:	   4.17.1 - Determine the result of executing recursive algorithms that use strings 
2228:	              or collections.
2229:	      4.17.1.1 - Recursion can be used to traverse String objects, arrays, and ArrayList 
2230:	                 objects.
2231:	   4.17.2 - Determine the result of each iteration of a binary search algorithm 
2232:	              used to search for information in a collection.
2233:	      4.17.2.1 - Data must be in sorted order to use the binary search algorithm. 
2234:	                 Binary search starts at the middle of a sorted array or ArrayList and eliminates 
2235:	                 half of the array or ArrayList in each recursive call until the desired value 
2236:	                 is found or all elements have been eliminated. 
2237:	      4.17.2.2 - Binary search is typically more efficient than linear search. Note: 
2238:	                 Search algorithms other than linear and binary search are outside the scope 
2239:	                 of the AP Computer Science A course and exam.
2240:	      4.17.2.3 - The binary search algorithm can be written either iteratively or 
2241:	                 recursively.
2242:	   4.17.3 - Determine the result of each iteration of the merge sort algorithm when 
2243:	              used to sort a collection.
2244:	      4.17.3.1 - Merge sort is a recursive sorting algorithm that can be used to 
2245:	                 sort elements in an array or ArrayList. Note: Sorting algorithms other than 
2246:	                 selection, insertion, and merge sort are outside the scope of the AP Computer 
2247:	                 Science A course and exam. 
2248:	      4.17.3.2 - Merge sort repeatedly divides an array into smaller subarrays until 
2249:	                 each subarray is one element and then recursively merges the sorted subarrays 
2250:	                 back together in sorted  order to form the final sorted array.

2646:	includes a departure time and an arrival time.
2647:	You may assume that the two times occur on the

2666:	For example, assume that t1 and t2 are Time 
2667:	objects where t1 represents 1:00 p.m. and t2 
2668:	represents 2:15 p.m. The call t1.minutesUntil(t2) 
2669:	will return 75 and the call t2.minutesUntil(t1) 
2670:	will return -75. The declaration for the Flight class 
2671:	is shown below. It has methods to access the 
2672:	departure time and the arrival time of a flight. 
2673:	You may assume that the departure time of a 
2674:	flight is earlier than its arrival time.
2675:	public class Flight {

2790:	Consider the hierarchy of classes shown in the 
2791:	following diagram
2792:	         +----------+ 
2793:	         |    Pet   |

2802:	                       +----------+
2803:	Note that a Cat 'is-a' Pet, a Dog 'is-a' Pet, and 
2804:	a LoudDog 'is-a' Dog. The class Pet is specified 
2805:	as an abstract class as shown in the following 
2806:	declaration. Each Pet has a name that is 
2807:	specified when it is constructed.
2808:	public abstract class Pet {
2809:	    private String name;
2810:	    public Pet(String petName) {
2811:	        name = petName;
2812:	    }
2813:	    public String getName() {
2814:	        return name;
2815:	    }
2816:	    public abstract String speak();
2817:	}
2818:	The subclass Dog has the partial class 
2819:	declaration shown below.
2820:	public class Dog extends Pet {
2821:	    public Dog(String petName) {
2822:	        /* implementation not shown */
2823:	    }
2824:	    public String speak() {
2825:	        /* implementation not shown */
2826:	    }
2827:	}
2828:	// Question 3...
2829:	Given the class hierarchy shown above, write a 
2830:	complete class declaration for the class Cat, 
2831:	including implementations of its constructor 
2832:	and method(s). The Cat method speak returns 
2833:	'meow' when it is invoked.
2834:	// An answer could be...
2835:	public class Cat extends Pet {
2836:	    public Cat(String petName) {
2837:	        super(petName);
2838:	    }
2839:	    public String speak() {
2840:	        return "meow";
2841:	    }
2842:	}
2843:	// Question 4...
2844:	Assume that class Dog has been declared as shown 
2845:	at the beginning of the question. If the String 
2846:	dog-sound is returned by the Dog method speak, 
2847:	then the LoudDog method method speak returns a 
2848:	String containing dog-sound repeated two times. 
2849:	Given the class hierarchy shown previously, 
2850:	write a complete class declaration for the class 
2851:	LoudDog including implementations of its 
2852:	constructor and method(s).
2853:	// An answer could be...
2854:	public class LoudDog extends Dog {
2855:	    public LoudDog(String petName) {
2856:	        super(petName);
2857:	    }
2858:	    public String speak() {
2859:	        return super.speak() + super.speak();
2860:	    }
2861:	}
2862:	// Question 5...
2863:	Consider the following partial declaration of 
2864:	class Kennel
2865:	public class Kennel {
2866:	    private ArrayList<Pet> petList;
2867:	     /**
2868:	      * For every Pet in the kennel, prints the name 
2869:	      * followed by the result of a call to its speak 
2870:	      * method, one line per Pet
2871:	      */
2872:	     public void allSpeak() {
2873:	        /* to be implemented */
2874:	     }
2875:	     // There may be instance variables, constructors, 
2876:	     // and methods that are not shown
2877:	}
2878:	Write the Kennel method allSpeak For each Pet in 
2879:	the kennel, allSpeak prints a line with the name 
2880:	of the Pet followed by the result of a call to 
2881:	its speak method. In writing allSpeak you may use 
2882:	any of the methods defined for any of the classes 
2883:	specified for this problem. Assume that these 
2884:	methods work as specified, regardless of what 
2885:	you wrote in previous questions. Complete method
2886:	allSpeak below
2887:	public void allSpeak()
2888:	// An answer could be...
2889:	public void allSpeak() {
