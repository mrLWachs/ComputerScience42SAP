1347:	Computer Science 42SAP Course:.............................................................
1348:	Computer Science 42SAP curriculum content..................................................
1349:	AP curriculum - Part 1.....................................................................
1350:	Unit 1 - Primitive Types ..................................................................
1351:	1.1 - Why Programming? Why Java?...........................................................
1352:	   1.1.1 - Call System class methods to generate output to the console
1353:	      1.1.1.1 - System.out.print and System.out.println display information on the 
1354:	                 computer monitor 
1355:	      1.1.1.2 - System.out.println moves the cursor to a new line after  the information 
1356:	                 has been displayed, while System.out.print does not     
1357:	   1.1.2 - Create string literals
1358:	      1.1.2.1 - A string literal is enclosed in double quotes     
1359:	System.out.print outputs text to the screen and System.out.println outputs with a line break
1360:	More specifically, the code word "System" refers to the "computer system" and the 
1361:	word "out" refers to outputting, and finally the word "print" or "println" are calls to 
1362:	methods (or "actions") that take the string literal (which is the word or words in between 
1363:	the quotation marks) and outputs it. So the command "System.out.println("literal");" 
1364:	will take the string literal and output it to the default output device - that being the 
1365:	computer screen.
1366:	1.2 - Variables and Data Types.............................................................
1367:	   1.2.1 - Identify the most appropriate data type category for a particular specification
1368:	      1.2.1.1 - A type is a set of values (a domain) and a set of operations on 
1369:	                 them 
1370:	      1.2.1.2 - Data types can be categorized as either primitive or reference 
1371:	      1.2.1.3 - The primitive data types used in this course define the set of operations 
1372:	                 for numbers and Boolean values 
1373:	   1.2.1 - Declare variables of the correct types to represent primitive data
1374:	      1.2.1.1 - The three primitive data types used in this course are int, double, 
1375:	                 and boolean 
1376:	      1.2.1.2 - Each variable has associated memory that is used to hold its value 
1377:	      1.2.1.3 - The memory associated with a variable of a primitive type holds 
1378:	                 an actual primitive value 
1379:	      1.2.1.4 - When a variable is declared final, its value cannot be changed once 
1380:	                 it is initialized 
1381:	Data/information refers to the "kind" of data being stored (or "remembered") by the program 
1382:	in a "variable". A variable is a piece of the computer's memory (storage) that has a "name" 
1383:	(or "address") so that the programmer can refer to it by that name. The "type" refers to the 
1384:	"kind" of data that you are storing (e.g. text, numbers, true/false, etc.). The type must be 
1385:	specified at the time you write a line of code to "create" (or "declare") the variable. A 
1386:	variable can only be one type and only store that specified type of data. However, the data 
1387:	itself can change (or "vary") after the initial declaration. Examples of this are below...
1388:	// Variables declared and assigned initial ("starting") values:
1389:	boolean a = true;
1390:	int     b = 0;
1391:	double  c = 1.0;
1392:	char    d = 'A';
1393:	// Variables content changes ("reassigned"):
1394:	a = false;
1395:	b = 1;
1396:	c = 1.1;
1397:	d = 'B';
1398:	A "final" (or a "constant") is a variable in which the stored value does NOT change 
1399:	(it stays "constant") and it locked at that value. Final (or constant) variables are 
1400:	given the initial value when declared (or initialized) and that value stays locked. These 
1401:	types of values are written in ALL_CAPS with the underscore value used to seperate words in 
1402:	the name. Final variables are more efficient for a number of reasons including ease of code 
1403:	understanding, speed (faster code), easier to update code, and others. Examples of finals 
1404:	are below
1405:	// Constants (finals) declared (initialized)
1406:	final boolean FOUND  = true;
1407:	final int     VALUE  = 1;
1408:	final double  AMOUNT = 2.5;
1409:	final char    CODE   = 'X';
1410:	1.3 - Expressions and Assignment Statements................................................
1411:	   1.3.1 - Evaluate arithmetic expressions in a program code
1412:	      1.3.1.1 - A literal is the source code representation of a fixed value
1413:	      1.3.1.2 - Arithmetic expressions include expressions of type int and double 
1414:	      1.3.1.3 - The arithmetic operators consist of +, −, *, /, and % 
1415:	      1.3.1.4 - An arithmetic operation that uses two int values will evaluate to 
1416:	                 an int value 
1417:	      1.3.1.5 - An arithmetic operation that uses a double value will evaluate to 
1418:	                 a double value 
1419:	      1.3.1.6 - Operators can be used to construct compound expressions 
1420:	      1.3.1.7 - During evaluation, operands are associated with operators according 
1421:	                 to operator precedence to determine how they are grouped 
1422:	      1.3.1.8 - An attempt to divide an integer by zero will result in an ArithmeticException 
1423:	                 to occur 
1424:	   1.3.2 - Evaluate what is stored in a variable as a result of an expression with 
1425:	              an assignment statement
1426:	      1.3.2.1 - The assignment operator (=) allows a program to initialize or change 
1427:	                 the value stored in a variable. The value of the expression on the right is 
1428:	                 stored in the variable on the left 
1429:	      1.3.2.2 - During execution, expressions are evaluated to produce a single 
1430:	                 value 
1431:	      1.3.2.3 - The value of an expression has a type based on the evaluation of 
1432:	                 the expression 
1433:	Arithmetic (or "math") statements in code are lines of code (or "statements") that are 
1434:	written to evaluate (or "solve") an equation of logic the program needs to solve. In this 
1435:	context, the word "literal" can also mean a number (like "5"). This usually involves 
1436:	variable types int and double (the number types) used in a math expression or equation. This 
1437:	can involve math operations like +, -, *, / and % (modulus). When multiple int values are 
1438:	evaluated in a formula, they always evaluate to an int answer (solution) and double values 
1439:	will evaluate to a double. Complex (or "compound" expressions can be formed in which 
1440:	the order of operations (or precedence order). This means multiplication and division are 
1441:	evaluated before addition and subtraction. If operations are at the same precedence level, 
1442:	then they are evaluated from left to right.When you try and divide by zero, an error 
1443:	(the "ArithmeticException" error) will occur and the program will stop running. Examples:
1444:	// Arithmetic evaluations using variables
1445:	int    v1 = 5;
1446:	int    v2 = 3;
1447:	int    v3 = (v1 + 5 * v2 / (1 + 2)) % 2;
1448:	double v4 = 5.2;
1449:	double v5 = 3.3;
1450:	double v6 = (v4 + 5.1 * v5 / (1.2 + 2.3)) % 2.2;
1451:	1.4 - Compound Assignment Operators........................................................
1452:	   1.4.1 - Evaluate what is stored in a variable as a result of an expression with 
1453:	              an assignment statement
1454:	      1.4.1.1 - Compound assignment operators (+=, −=, *=, /=, %=) can be used in 
1455:	                 place of the assignment operator 
1456:	      1.4.1.2 - The increment operator (++) and decrement operator (−−) are used 
1457:	                 to add 1 or subtract 1 from the stored value of a variable or an array element. 
1458:	                 The new value is assigned to the variable or array element
1459:	Compound statements in this context refers to using shortcuts to quickly add or subtract one 
1460:	(increment or decrement) to a variable. You can also use more complex shorthand compound 
1461:	statements to quickly multiply, divide, even modulus a variable with itself or other 
1462:	variables. For example:
1463:	// Shorthand Compound Arithmetic expressions
1464:	int value = 5;
1465:	value++;    // is the same as "value = value + 1;"
1466:	value--;    // is the same as "value = value + 1;"
1467:	value += 5; // is the same as "value = value + 5;"
1468:	value -= 5; // is the same as "value = value - 5;"
1469:	value *= 5; // is the same as "value = value * 5;"
1470:	value /= 5; // is the same as "value = value / 5;"
1471:	value %= 5; // is the same as "value = value % 5;"
1472:	1.5 - Casting and Ranges of Variables......................................................
1473:	   1.5.1 - Evaluate arithmetic expressions that use casting
1474:	      1.5.1.1 - The casting operators (int) and (double) can be used to create a 
1475:	                 temporary value converted to a different data type
1476:	      1.5.1.2 - Casting a double value to an int causes the digits to the right 
1477:	                 of the decimal point to be truncated
1478:	      1.5.1.3 - Some programming code causes int values to be automatically cast 
1479:	                 (widened) to double values
1480:	      1.5.1.4 - Values of type double can be rounded to the nearest integer by (int)(x 
1481:	                 + 0.5) or (int)(x – 0.5) for negative numbers 
1482:	      1.5.1.5 - Integer values in Java are represented by values of type int, which 
1483:	                 are stored using a finite amount (4 bytes) of memory. Therefore, an int value 
1484:	                 must be in the range from Integer.MIN_VALUE to Integer.MAX_VALUE inclusive
1485:	      1.5.1.6 - If an expression would evaluate to an int value outside of the allowed 
1486:	                 range, an integer overflow occurs. This could result in an incorrect value 
1487:	                 within the allowed range 
1488:	Casting is the process of "converting" one data type into another data type. When casting 
1489:	an double to a int, the decimal portion of the double is truncated (cut off) and not rounded 
1490:	off. When a int is cast to a double, the int is "widened" to now accomodate any decimals. 
1491:	A char when cast will turn into it's ASCII value. The process of casting involves putting 
1492:	variable to be cast with the type being cast into in round brackets to the left of that 
1493:	variable. Integer values hold a finite amount of number space (4 bytes) and the built-in 
1494:	constants Integer.MAX_VALUE and MIN_VALUE are the limits of the int. If an expression 
1495:	evaluates an int outside that range, an error will occur (overflow error). For example:
1496:	// Casting data types
1497:	int integer = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
1498:	double doub = Double.MIN_VALUE;
1499:	doub        = (int)integer;
1500:	integer     = (int)doub;
1501:	char letter = 'A';
1502:	integer     = (int)letter;
1503:	Unit 3 - Boolean Expressions And If Statements            .................................
1504:	3.1 - Boolean Expressions  ................................................................
1505:	   3.1.1 - Evaluate Boolean expressions that use relational operators in program 
1506:	              code
1507:	      3.1.1.1 - Primitive values and reference values can be compared using relational 
1508:	                 operators (i.e., == and !=) 
1509:	      3.1.1.2 - Arithmetic expression values can be compared using relational operators 
1510:	                 (i.e., <, >, <=, >=) 
1511:	      3.1.1.3 - An expression involving relational operators evaluates to a Boolean 
1512:	                 value 
1513:	A Boolean (true/false) expression is a code statement most likely in a control structure 
1514:	like a conditional statement or loop control structure that evaluates to true or false to 
1515:	make decisions and control the flow of the program. The Boolean expression will require 
1516:	the use of relational operators like: < , > , <= , >= , == , and != those being: "less 
1517:	than", "greater than", "less than or equal to", "greater than or equal to", "equal 
1518:	to", and "not equal to".
1519:	3.2 - if Statements and Control Flow  .....................................................
1520:	   3.2.1 - Represent branching logical processes by using conditional Statements
1521:	      3.2.1.1 -  Conditional statements interrupt the sequential execution of statements 
1522:	      3.2.1.2 -  if statements affect the flow of control by executing different 
1523:	                 statements based on the value of a Boolean Expression 
1524:	      3.2.1.3 -  A one-way selection (if statement) is written when there is a set 
1525:	                 of statements to execute under a certain condition. In this case, the body 
1526:	                 is executed only when the Boolean condition is true 
1527:	A "Conditional Statement" is also known under other names like "branching statement", "if 
1528:	statement", "one-way selection statement", and "control structure". It uses the reserved 
1529:	keyword "if" along with round brackets which contain the Boolean expression, and curly 
1530:	brackets to contain the control block of all code you wish to be controlled by the 
1531:	conditional statement. Brackets are optional if the block is only one line, and you may also 
1532:	move thos lines up to the same line as the conditional statement. For example:
1533:	// Example of if statements
1534:	int a = 10;
1535:	int b = 10;
1536:	if (a == a) {
1537:	    // "equal"
1538:	}
1539:	3.3 - if-else Statements  .................................................................
1540:	   3.3.1 -  Represent branching logical processes by using conditional Statements
1541:	      3.3.1.1 -  A two-way selection is written when there are two sets of statements— 
1542:	                 one to be executed when the Boolean condition is true, and another set for 
1543:	                 when the Boolean condition is false. In this case, the body of the "if" is 
1544:	                 executed when the Boolean condition is true, and the body of the "else" is 
1545:	                 executed when the Boolean condition is false 
1546:	The "else" statement is paired with an "if" statement to control the flow of the logic so 
1547:	that the conditional now evaluates to both true and false. This can be called a "two 
1548:	way selection" (for true/false). An "else" must always follow an "if" statement first. 
1549:	For example:
1550:	// if with "else" 
1551:	double c = 1.45, d = 1.5; 
1552:	if (c < d) {
1553:	    // "Less than"
1554:	}
1555:	else {
1556:	    // "Greater than"
1557:	}
1558:	// Shortened lines version
1559:	char e = 'A';
1560:	char f = 'a';
1561:	if (e != f) e = '!';
1562:	else        e = '=';
1563:	3.4 - else if Statements  .................................................................
1564:	   3.4.1 -  Represent branching logical processes by using conditional Statements
1565:	      3.4.1.1 -  A multi-way selection is written when there are a series of conditions 
1566:	                 with different statements for each condition. Multi-way selection is performed 
1567:	                 using if-else-if statements such that exactly one section of code is executed 
1568:	                 based on the first condition that evaluates to true
1569:	When making multiple decisions (more than 2), the "else if" statement is added to an 
1570:	existing "if" statement to have multiple branches of logic for the code to follow. This 
1571:	is much more efficient than seperate "if" statements. This can also be called "multi-way 
1572:	selection" (or "if-else-if"). An "else" statement is also still the final option (but 
1573:	this is not required). For example:
1574:	// Showing a "chain" of else if statements
1575:	int g = 0;
1576:	if (g == 1) {
1577:	    // The first if is true
1578:	}
1579:	else if (g == 2) {
1580:	    // The next if is true
1581:	}
1582:	else if (g == 3) {
1583:	    // The next if (in the "chain" of ifs) is true
1584:	}
1585:	else {
1586:	    // Nothing above is true, so go to this else
1587:	}
1588:	3.5 - Compound Boolean Expressions  .......................................................
1589:	   3.5.1 -  Represent branching logical processes by using nested conditional statements
1590:	      3.5.1.1 -  Nested if statements consist of if statements within if statements 
1591:	   3.5.2 -  Evaluate compound Boolean expressions in program code
1592:	      3.5.2.1 -  Logical operators !(not), &&(and), and ||(or) are used with Boolean 
1593:	                 values. This represents the order these operators will be evaluated 
1594:	      3.5.2.2 -  An expression involving logical operators evaluates to a Boolean 
1595:	                 value 
1596:	      3.5.2.3 -  When the result of a logical expression using && or || can be determined 
1597:	                 by evaluating only the first Boolean operand, the second is not evaluated. 
1598:	                 This is known as short-circuited evaluation 
1599:	The process of "nesting" means to place one conditional statement inside the "block" of 
1600:	another conditional statement. The logical operators: "and", "or", and "not" are 
1601:	represented with the symbols: "&&" (and), "||" (or), and "!" (not). The operator AND 
1602:	is used to combine logical boolean expressions such that ALL expressions need to be true for 
1603:	the entire statement to be true. The operator OR is used to combine logical boolean 
1604:	expressions such that ANY expression can be true for the entire statement to be true. The 
1605:	operator NOT reverses the logic so that true statements are evaluated as false (and visa 
1606:	versa). If the statement contains multiple Boolean expressions and the result of the 
1607:	evaluation of one expression has already determined the expressions result, then the 
1608:	rest of the expressions do not need to be evaluated - this is known as a "short-circuited 
1609:	evaluation". For example:
1610:	// Logical operators and "nesting"
1611:	int    age = 17;
1612:	double iq  = 1.0;
1613:	if (age >= 18 && iq > 90) {
1614:	    // with "and" ("&&") BOTH have to be true
1615:	}
1616:	else if (age >= 18 || iq > 0) {
1617:	    // with "or" ("||") EITHER can be true
1618:	}
1619:	else {
1620:	    // Case if neither evaluates
1621:	    if (age > 0) {
1622:	        // A "nested if statement"
1623:	    }
1624:	}
1625:	3.6 - Equivalent Boolean Expressions  .....................................................
1626:	   3.6.1 -  Compare and contrast equivalent Boolean expressions
1627:	      3.6.1.1 - De Morgan’s Laws can be applied to Boolean expressions 
1628:	      3.6.1.2 - Truth tables can be used to prove Boolean identities 
1629:	      3.6.1.3 -  Equivalent Boolean expressions will evaluate to the same value 
1630:	                 in all cases 
1631:	Boolean (true/false) expressions turned into logical statements used by control structures 
1632:	like conditional statements are subject to the laws of mathemtical logic such as "De Morgan's 
1633:	Law" (Google search this if you are curious, but it applies to mathematical proofs and is 
1634:	not necessarily applicable to this exam). This just means that complex statements need to be 
1635:	evaluated by using mathematical rules (like "order of operations") and logical operators 
1636:	(like "and, or, not") to determine the final Boolean result. This could determine if a 
1637:	control structure (like an "if" statement) runs a block of code or not.
1638:	3.7 - Comparing Objects  ..................................................................
1639:	   3.7.1 -  Compare object references using Boolean expressions in program code
1640:	      3.7.1.1 -  Two object references are considered aliases when they both reference 
1641:	                 the same object 
1642:	      3.7.1.2 -  Object reference values can be compared, using == and !=, to identify 
1643:	                 aliases 
1644:	      3.7.1.3 -  A reference value can be compared with null, using == or !=, to 
1645:	                 determine if the reference actually references an object 
1646:	      3.7.1.4 -  Often classes have their own equals method, which can be used to 
1647:	                 determine whether two objects of the class are equivalent 
1648:	The use of an advanced data type like an "Object" in code means that comparison 
1649:	operators (like <, >, ==, !=) that are used with primitive data type (like "int, 
1650:	double, char, etc.") are not used. Instead, use the "built-in" method "equals()" to 
1651:	determine the equality of two objects. For example:
1652:	// Use of the built-in equals method with Objects
1653:	String word1 = "edgy";
1654:	String word2 = "edGy";
1655:	if (word1.equals(word2)) {
1656:	    // "W1=W2"
1657:	}
1658:	else if (word1.equalsIgnoreCase(word2)) {
1659:	    // "W1 kind of == W2"
1660:	}
1661:	Unit 4 - Iteration.........................................................................
1662:	4.1 - while Loops  ........................................................................
1663:	   4.1.1 - Represent iterative processes using a while loop
1664:	      4.1.1.1 - Iteration statements change the flow of control by repeating a set 
1665:	                 of statements zero or more times until a condition is met 
1666:	      4.1.1.2 - In loops, the Boolean expression is evaluated before each iteration 
1667:	                 of the loop body, including the first. When the expression evaluates to true, 
1668:	                 the loop body is executed. This continues until the expression evaluates to 
1669:	                 false, whereupon the iteration ceases 4.1.1.3 - A loop is an infinite loop 
1670:	                 when the Boolean expression always evaluates to true 
1671:	      4.1.1.4 - If the Boolean expression evaluates to false initially, the loop 
1672:	                 body is not executed at all
1673:	      4.1.1.5 - Executing a return statement inside an iteration statement will 
1674:	                 halt the loop and exit the method or constructor
1675:	   4.1.2 - For algorithms in the context of a particular specification that does 
1676:	              not require the use of traversals: (A) Identify standard algorithms, (B) Modify 
1677:	              standard algorithms, (C) Develop an algorithm 
1678:	      4.1.2.1 - There are standard algorithms to: (A) Identify if an integer is 
1679:	                 or is not evenly divisible by another integer, (B) Identify the individual 
1680:	                 digits in an integer, (C) Determine the frequency with which a specific criterion 
1681:	                 is met 
1682:	      4.1.2.2 - There are standard algorithms to: (A) Determine a minimum or maximum 
1683:	                 value, (B) Compute a sum, average, or mode
1684:	The word "Iteration" is another word for "Loop" or "Looping" which is a control 
1685:	struture to have code statements "repeat". Like conditional ("if") statements, iteration 
1686:	statements control the flow of a program's logic. Also like if statements, iteration 
1687:	statements are controlled by a Boolean expression (true or false). The result of the Boolean 
1688:	expression will result in the code executing zero or mulitple times (until the expression 
1689:	evaluates to false). The expression is evaluated each time through an iteration of the loop. 
1690:	A loop is called an "infinite" loop if the Boolean expression never evaluates to false 
1691:	(thus the loop never stops looping - or never stops running). It is possible a loop will 
1692:	never run if it evaluates to false before the body (block) of the loop. If you use the 
1693:	keyword "return" inside a loop body (block) then the loop will terminate (end) early and 
1694:	potentially exit any method the loop is written inside. The "while" loop is a event loop or 
1695:	non-deterministic loop, which means it is not usually used for counting but when you do 
1696:	not know how many times the loop needs to run (a certain event can cause the loop to 
1697:	end). Loops are used for a variety of reasons such as: repeating instructions, travelling 
1698:	(traversing) arrays and lists, and searching and sorting values. For example:
1699:	// Example of a simple while loop
1700:	int counter = 0;
1701:	while (counter < 10) {
1702:	    counter++;
1703:	}
1704:	4.2 - for Loops  ..........................................................................
1705:	   4.2.1 - Represent iterative processes using a for loop
1706:	      4.2.1.1 - There are three parts in a for loop header: the initialization, 
1707:	                 the Boolean expression, and the increment. The increment statement can also 
1708:	                 be a decrement statement 
1709:	      4.2.1.2 - In a for loop, the initialization statement is only executed once 
1710:	                 before the first Boolean expression evaluation. The variable being initialized 
1711:	                 is referred to as a loop control variable 
1712:	      4.2.1.3 - In each iteration of a for loop, the increment statement is executed 
1713:	                 after the entire loop body is executed and before the Boolean expression is 
1714:	                 evaluated again 
1715:	      4.2.1.4 - A for loop can be rewritten into an equivalent while loop and vice 
1716:	                 versa 
1717:	      4.2.1.5 - “Off by one” errors occur when the iteration statement loops one 
1718:	                 time too many or one time too few 
1719:	The "for" loop is another looping form. The for loop is a count controlled loop that 
1720:	generally is used when a loop needs to run a specific number of times. There are three 
1721:	parts to the for loop, that seperate the parts with two semi-colons. The 3 parts represent 
1722:	the starting, ending, and change of the loop. In a for loop a counting variable is 
1723:	generally declared right inside the loop to a starting value, then the Boolean condition 
1724:	to end the loop, then the change value increasing (increment) or decreasing (decrement) 
1725:	that value. A "for" loop can be rewritten as a "while" loop and vice versa. A "off 
1726:	by one" error occurs when a loop runs one too many or one too few times. For Example:
1727:	// Example of a for loop
1728:	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
1729:	    // potential code body...
1730:	}
1731:	4.3 - Developing Algorithms Using Strings  ................................................
1732:	   4.3.1 - For algorithms in the context of a particular specification that involves 
1733:	              String objects: (A) Identify standard algorithms, (B) Modify standard algorithms, 
1734:	              (C) Develop an Algorithm
1735:	      4.3.1.1 - There are standard algorithms that utilize String traversals to: 
1736:	                 (A) Find if one or more substrings has a particular property, (B) Determine 
1737:	                 the number of substrings that meet specific criteria, (C) Create a new string 
1738:	                 with the characters reversed 
1739:	The String class allows for several "built-in" methods of the String class to manipulate 
1740:	the string and the value it stores. Several of these methods could apply to the A.P. exam 
1741:	including travelling (traversing) string characters, pulling out substrings (parts 
1742:	of the string), reversing a string, etc. For example:
1743:	// Example of string methods with a loop
1744:	String word   = "completion";
1745:	String parts1 = word.substring(3);
1746:	String parts2 = word.substring(1,7);
1747:	for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
1748:	    char character = word.charAt(i);
1749:	}
1750:	4.4 - Nested Iteration  ...................................................................
1751:	   4.4.1 - Represent nested iterative processes
1752:	      4.4.1.1 - Nested iteration statements are iteration statements that appear 
1753:	                 in the body of another iteration statement 
1754:	      4.4.1.2 - When a loop is nested inside another loop, the inner loop must complete 
1755:	                 all its iterations before the outer loop can continue 
1756:	Like conditional ("if") statements, looping ("iteration") statments can be "nested", 
1757:	This means you can place a iteration statement inside the block of another iteration 
1758:	statement. The inner loop must complete all of its iterations before the outer loop 
1759:	can continue. For example:
1760:	// Example of nested loops
1761:	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
1762:	    for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
1763:	        int k = 10;
1764:	        while (k < 10) {
1765:	            // potential code body...
1766:	        }
1767:	    }
1768:	}
1769:	4.5 - Informal Code Analysis  .............................................................
1770:	   4.5.1 - Compute statement execution counts and informal run-time comparison of 
1771:	              iterative statements
1772:	      4.5.1.1 - A statement execution count indicates the number of times a statement 
1773:	                 is executed by the program 
1774:	Expect to "trace" loop values in A.P. exam questions. Examining, computing, and tracing 
1775:	loops are typical A.P. exam questions. You should practice these types of questions.
1776:	AP curriculum - Part 2.....................................................................
1777:	Unit 2 - Using Objects.....................................................................
1778:	2.1 - Objects: Instances of Classes........................................................
1779:	   2.1.1 - Explain the relationship between a class and an object
1780:	      2.1.1.1 - An object is a specific instance of a class with defined attributes 
1781:	      2.1.1.2 - A class is the formal implementation, or blueprint, of the attributes 
1782:	                 and behaviors of an object 
1783:	A "class" is the "blueprint" for creating an "object". In Java, the class is a way to 
1784:	use code to model "things" using properties and methods. The object is what the class 
1785:	"creates" when the class is made into a specific "object" of that class. The various 
1786:	terms used for this vary but all revolve around the same concepts. The term "object" 
1787:	can also be called a "instance" of the class. The term "properties" can also be 
1788:	called "things about the class", or "descriptors", or "adjectives", or 
1789:	"fields". The term "methods" could also be called "what the class can do", or 
1790:	"actions", or "verbs", or "functions". 
1791:	// Example of a simple class with properties and methods
1792:	class Person {
1793:	    String name;
1794:	    int age;
1795:	    void walk() {
1796:	        // code logic could go here
1797:	    }
1798:	    void talk() {
1799:	        // code logic could go here
1800:	    }
1801:	}
1802:	2.2 - Creating and Storing Objects (Instantiation).........................................
1803:	   2.2.1 - Identify, using its signature, the correct constructor being called
1804:	      2.2.1.1 - A signature consists of the constructor name and the parameter list 
1805:	      2.2.1.2 - The parameter list, in the header of a constructor, lists the types 
1806:	                 of the values that are passed and their variable names. These are often referred 
1807:	                 to as formal parameters 
1808:	      2.2.1.3 - A parameter is a value that is passed into a constructor. These 
1809:	                 are often referred to as actual parameters 
1810:	      2.2.1.4 - Constructors are said to be overloaded when there are multiple constructors 
1811:	                 with the same name but a different signature 
1812:	      2.2.1.5 - The actual parameters passed to a constructor must be compatible 
1813:	                 with the types identified in the formal parameter list 
1814:	      2.2.1.6 - Parameters are passed using call by value. Call by  value initializes 
1815:	                 the formal parameters with copies of the actual parameters 
1816:	   2.2.2 - For creating objects: a. Create objects by calling constructors without 
1817:	              parameters. b. Create objects by calling constructors with parameters
1818:	      2.2.2.1 - Every object is created using the keyword new followed by a call 
1819:	                 to one of the class’s constructors 
1820:	      2.2.2.2 - A class contains constructors that are invoked to create objects. 
1821:	                 They have the same name as the class 
1822:	      2.2.2.3 - Existing classes and class libraries can be utilized as appropriate 
1823:	                 to create objects 
1824:	      2.2.2.4 - Parameters allow values to be passed to the constructor to establish 
1825:	                 the initial state of the object 
1826:	   2.2.3 - Define variables of the correct types to represent reference data
1827:	      2.2.3.1 - The keyword null is a special value used to indicate that a reference 
1828:	                 is not associated with any object 
1829:	      2.2.3.2 - The memory associated with a variable of a reference type holds 
1830:	                 an object reference value or, if there is no object, null. This value is the 
1831:	                 memory address of the referenced object                
1832:	Methods are a way to break up code into logic modules and it also provides a way to avoid 
1833:	repeating code and be able to reuse sections of code logic. You can think of methods as 
1834:	analogous to "machines" that perform "actions" and you can reuse. They are also analogous to 
1835:	"functions" in math that may take a variable "input" and generate an "answer".  The term 
1836:	"parameter" (and you may have zero, one, or more than one) is the "input" (if needed) to a 
1837:	method that is passed to the method. The value(s) passed are called "argument(s)". When you 
1838:	define the method in the method "signature" line, the round brackets can contain 
1839:	parameters separated by comma (if needed). A method may also give an "output" in the form 
1840:	of its "return" value (which also might not be needed, in which case it is a "void" method).
1841:	A method is "overloaded" if you have more than one method with the exact same name but 
1842:	different parameters. Classes have "constructor" methods that are called when 
1843:	a class is instantiated into an object. Constructor methods do not have a return type 
1844:	(not even the keyword "void"). They must have the exact same name as the class (including a 
1845:	capital letter). They are used to set the properties of the class to starting (or 
1846:	"default") values. If a class has multiple constructor methods, they are said to be 
1847:	overloaded constructors. When a line of code is used to instantiate a class into an instance 
1848:	of that class, the line includes the name of the class, the identifier name of the object, 
1849:	then an equals ("="), then the keyword "new" (which allots new memory for this 
1850:	advanced data type), then a call to a constructor method. If not constructor method 
1851:	is called, then the object references a "null" value until such time it is given a value to 
1852:	reference.
1853:	// Example of a class with constructors and instantiation
1854:	class Person {
1855:	    Person() {
1856:	        // code logic
1857:	    }
1858:	    Person(int age) {
1859:	        // code logic
1860:	    }
1861:	}
1862:	Person person1 = new Person();
1863:	Person person2 = new Person(5);
1864:	2.3 - Calling a Void Method................................................................
1865:	   2.3.1 - Call non-static void methods without parameters
1866:	      2.3.1.1 - An object’s behavior refers to what the object can do (or what can 
1867:	                 be done to it) and is defined by methods 
1868:	      2.3.1.2 -  Procedural abstraction allows a programmer to use a method by knowing 
1869:	                 what the method does even if they do not know how the method was written 
1870:	      2.3.1.3 -  A method signature for a method without parameters consists of 
1871:	                 the method name and an empty parameter list
1872:	      2.3.1.4 -  A method or constructor call interrupts the sequential execution 
1873:	                 of statements, causing the program to first execute the statements in the 
1874:	                 method or constructor before continuing. Once the last statement in the method 
1875:	                 or constructor has executed or a return statement is executed, flow of control 
1876:	                 is returned to the point immediately following where the method or constructor 
1877:	                 was called 
1878:	      2.3.1.5 -  Non-static methods are called through objects of the Class 
1879:	      2.3.1.6 -  The dot operator is used along with the object name to call non-static 
1880:	                 methods 
1881:	      2.3.1.7 -  Void methods do not have return values and are therefore not called 
1882:	                 as part of an expression 
1883:	      2.3.1.8 -  Using a null reference to call a method or access an instance variable 
1884:	                 causes a NullPointerException to be thrown 
1885:	A "non-static" method is a method (meaning a "action", "behaviour", "procedure", 
1886:	or "verb") that does not use the "static" modifier word in the method signature line. 
1887:	A method with no prameters (or "inputs") means the method is defined with empty round 
1888:	brackets "( )". The "behavior" or action the method performs is defined in the body 
1889:	block of the method (between the two curly "{ }" brackets). The A.P. term "procedural 
1890:	abstraction" refers to a programmer being able to call a method without knowing how the 
1891:	method was written (also known as "black box" programming). When methods are "called" 
1892:	the execution flow stops, jumps and runs all the method body (or until a "return" 
1893:	statement) and then returns to the next line of execution after the method call line 
1894:	(or part of a code expression line). Methods can also be called from objects (or 
1895:	"instances") of a class using the dot "." operator. Void method do not return anthing 
1896:	(no "outputs") and use the keyword modifier "void" in the method signature in place of 
1897:	the return type.
1898:	// Examples of methods, parameters, return, and calling
1899:	public void show() {
1900:	    System.out.println("*")
1901:	}
1902:	public void show(char value) {
1903:	    System.out.println(value);
1904:	}
1905:	public int double(int number) {
1906:	    return number * 2;
1907:	} 
1908:	show();
1909:	show('A');
1910:	int answer = double(5);
1911:	2.4 - Calling a Void Method with Parameters ...............................................
1912:	   2.4.1 -  Call non-static void methods with parameters
1913:	      2.4.1.1 -  A method signature for a method with parameters consists of the 
1914:	                 method name and the ordered list of parameter types 
1915:	      2.4.1.2 -  Values provided in the parameter list need to correspond to the 
1916:	                 order and type in the method Signature 
1917:	      2.4.1.3 -  Methods are said to be overloaded when there are multiple methods 
1918:	                 with the same name but a different Signature 
1919:	A "non-static void" methods with parameters is a method with no outputs, but has input(s). 
1920:	This means the method signature has defined parameter(s) within the round brackets "( )" 
1921:	seperated by commas (if necessary). When this type of method is called, the "arguments" 
1922:	passed to this method must be in the same order in terms of data type. A method is 
1923:	"overloaded" when you have two or more methods with the same name but different and 
1924:	distinct parameter lists.
1925:	// Examples of method overloading
1926:	public void show() {
1927:	    System.out.println("*")
1928:	}
1929:	public void show(char value) {
1930:	    System.out.println(value);
1931:	}
1932:	public void show(int value) {
1933:	    System.out.println(value);
1934:	}
1935:	2.5 - Calling a Non-void Method  ..........................................................
1936:	   2.5.1 -  Call non-static non-void methods with or without parameters
1937:	      2.5.1.1 -  Non-void methods return a value that is the same type as the return 
1938:	                 type in the signature. To use the return value when calling a non-void method, 
1939:	                 it must be stored in a variable or used as part of an expression 
1940:	A method that does return a value, defines the return "type" in the method signature and 
1941:	the keyword "return" somewhere in the method body (at least once). When calling a return 
1942:	method, the value returned must be stored (in a variable) or used as part of an expression.
1943:	2.6 - String Objects: Concatenation, Literals, and More  ..................................
1944:	   2.6.1 -  For String class: a. Create String objects. b. Call String Methods
1945:	      2.6.1.1 -  String objects can be created by using string literals or by calling 
1946:	                 the String class constructor 
1947:	      2.6.1.2 -  String objects are immutable, meaning that String methods do not 
1948:	                 change the String object 
1949:	      2.6.1.3 -  String objects can be concatenated using the + or += operator, 
1950:	                 resulting in a new String object 
1951:	      2.6.1.4 -  Primitive values can be concatenated with a String object. This 
1952:	                 causes implicit conversion of the values to String objects 
1953:	      2.6.1.5 -  Escape sequences start with a \ and have a special meaning in Java. 
1954:	                 Escape sequences used in this course include \", \\, and \n 
1955:	The "String" class allows you to create String variables, concatenate them (join) 
1956:	together and use "built-in" methods of the String class. String literals (contained in 
1957:	quotes "") can be assigned to String variables or concatenated with Strings. String methods 
1958:	do not change the String ("immutable") object. The "+" or the "+=" operators can be used 
1959:	to concatenate Strings (resulting in a new String object). Primitives (like int, double, 
1960:	etc.) can also be concatenated with String objects. Those are now automatically converted 
1961:	to Strings and then concatenated. Escape sequences is the character "\" followed 
1962:	by another character to make certain outputs or changes to a String object. These include: 
1963:	\" for a quote, \\ for a slash, and \n for a new line.
1964:	// Examples of Strings and escape sequences
1965:	String str1 = "cat";
1966:	String str2 = str1 + "ty";
1967:	str1 += str2;
1968:	str2 = "\n" + str1 + "\\" + "\" dog";
1969:	2.7 - String Methods.......................................................................
1970:	   2.7.1 -  For String class: a. Create String objects. b. Call String methods
1971:	      2.7.1.1 -  Application program interfaces (APIs) and libraries simplify complex 
1972:	                 programming tasks 
1973:	      2.7.1.2 -  Documentation for APIs and libraries are essential to understanding 
1974:	                 the attributes and behaviors of an object of a class 
1975:	      2.7.1.3 -  Classes in the APIs and libraries are grouped into Packages 
1976:	      2.7.1.4 -  The String class is part of the java.lang package. Classes in the 
1977:	                 java.lang package are available by Default 
1978:	      2.7.1.5 -  A String object has index values from 0 to length – 1. Attempting 
1979:	                 to access indices outside this range will result in an IndexOutOfBoundsException 
1980:	      2.7.1.6 -  A String object can be concatenated with an object reference, which 
1981:	                 implicitly calls the referenced object's toString method 
1982:	      2.7.1.7 -  The following String methods and constructors—including what they 
1983:	                 do and when they are used—are part of the Java Quick Reference: (A) String(String 
1984:	                 str) — Constructs a new String object that represents the same sequence of 
1985:	                 characters as str (B) int length() — Returns the number of characters in a 
1986:	                 String object (C) String substring(int from) — Returns substring(from, length()) 
1987:	                 (D) int indexOf(String str) — Returns the index of the first occurrence of 
1988:	                 str; returns -1 if not found (E) boolean equals(String other) — Returns true 
1989:	                 if this is equal to other; returns false otherwise (F) int compareTo(String 
1990:	                 other) — Returns a value < 0 if this is less than other; returns zero if this 
1991:	                 is equal to other; returns a value > 0 if this is greater than other  
1992:	      2.7.1.8 -  A string identical to the single element substring at position 
1993:	                 index can be created by calling substring(index, index + 1) 
1994:	The "API" or Application Program Interface is a "library" of code that could be imported 
1995:	into a Java project or it could automatically be part of every Java project without needing 
1996:	an import. Classes and libraries are organized into "packages" in Java (also known as 
1997:	"namespaces"). The String class is in the "java.lang" package. Strings are collections 
1998:	of "char" values index from 0 up to the length of the String minus 1 (just like arrays 
1999:	are indexed). String methods used are: the String constructor "String s = new String();", 
2000:	the "length()" method, the "substring(int)" and "substring(int,int)" methods, the 
2001:	"indexOf(String)" method, the "equals(String)" method, and the 
2002:	"compareTo(String)" method.
2003:	// Examples of String methods
2004:	String str3 = new String("chatty");
2005:	// Constructs object with same sequence of characters as str3
2006:	int length = str3.length();
2007:	// Returns the number of characters in a String object
2008:	String str4 = str3.substring(1);
2009:	// Returns substring(from) starting at index "from" to the end
2010:	String str5 = str3.substring(1,3);
2011:	// Returns substring(from, to) starting at index "from" to index "to"
2012:	int index = str3.indexOf("hat");
2013:	// Returns the index of the first occurrence (returns -1 if not found)
2014:	boolean result1 = str3.equals(str4);
2015:	// Returns true if this is equal to other (returns false otherwise)
2016:	int result2 = str3.compareTo(str5);

2020:	   2.8.1 -  For wrapper classes: a. Create Integer objects, b. Call Integer methods, 
2021:	              c. Create Double objects, d. Call Double Methods
2022:	      2.8.1.1 -  The Integer class and Double class are part of the java.lang package 
2023:	      2.8.1.2 -  The following Integer methods and constructors — including what 
2024:	                 they do and when they are used—are part of the Java Quick Reference: (A) Integer(int 
2025:	                 value) — Constructs a new Integer object that represents the specified int 
2026:	                 value (B) Integer.MIN_VALUE — The minimum value represented by an int or Integer 
2027:	                 (C) Integer.MAX_VALUE — The maximum value represented by an int or Integer 
2028:	                 (D) int intValue() — Returns the value of this Integer as an Int 
2029:	      2.8.1.3 -  The following Double methods and constructors— including what they 
2030:	                 do and when they are used—are part of the Java Quick Reference: (A) double 
2031:	                 doubleValue() — Returns the value of this Double as a double 
2032:	      2.8.1.4 -  Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes 
2033:	                 between primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes. This 
2034:	                 includes converting an int to an Integer and a double to a Double 
2035:	      2.8.1.5 -  The Java compiler applies autoboxing when a primitive value is: 
2036:	                 (A) Passed as a parameter to a method that expects an object of the corresponding 
2037:	                 wrapper class. (B) Assigned to a variable of the corresponding wrapper class 
2038:	      2.8.1.6 -  Unboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes 
2039:	                 from the wrapper class to the primitive type. This includes converting an 
2040:	                 Integer to an int and a Double to a double 
2041:	      2.8.1.7 -  The Java compiler applies unboxing when a wrapper class object 
2042:	                 is: (A) Passed as a parameter to a method that expects a value of the corresponding 
2043:	                 primitive type (B) Assigned to a variable of the corresponding primitive type 
2044:	A "wrapper class" is a class type that is based in a primitive data type. For example the 
2045:	primitive data type "int" has the wrapper class "Integer". Similarily, the "Double" 
2046:	wrapper class, wraps around the "double" primitive type. The wrapper classes (using a 
2047:	capital letter) are part of java.lang and have built-in methods like "parseInt()" and 
2048:	"parseDouble()". Other methods include: "Integer(int)" a constructor, 
2049:	"Double(double)" a constructor, "MIN_VALUE" a constant, "MAX_VALUE", "intValue()", and 
2050:	"doubleValue()". Boxing and unboxing can be done between the wrapper classes and the 
2051:	primitive types (known as "autoboxing"). The term "boxing" means the conversion between 
2052:	primitive types and corresponding wrapper. The term "unboxing" means the conversion 
2053:	from the wrapper class to the primitive type.
2054:	// Example of wrapper classes and methods...
2055:	int     integerPrimitive1 = Integer.parseInt("10");
2056:	double  doublePrimitive1  = Double.parseDouble("1.2");
2057:	Integer integerObject     = new Integer("10");
2058:	Double  doubleObject      = new Double("1.2");
2059:	int     integerPrimitive2 = integerObject.intValue();
2060:	double  doublePrimitive2  = doubleObject.doubleValue();
2061:	int     minInteger        = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
2062:	int     maxInteger        = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
2063:	double  minDouble         = Double.MIN_VALUE;
2064:	double  maxDouble         = Double.MAX_VALUE;
2065:	// Boxing and unboxing...
2066:	int     integerPrimitive3 = integerObject1;
2067:	double  doublePrimitive3  = doubleObject1;
2068:	Integer integerObject2    = integerPrimitive3;
2069:	Double  doubleObject2     = doublePrimitive3;
2070:	2.9 - Using the Math Class  ...............................................................
2071:	   2.9.1 -  Call static methods
2072:	      2.9.1.1 - Static methods are called using the dot operator along with the 
2073:	                 class name unless they are defined in the enclosing class 
2074:	   2.9.2 -  Evaluate expressions that use the Math class methods
2075:	      2.9.2.1 -  The Math class is part of the java.lang package 
2076:	      2.9.2.2 -  The Math class contains only static methods 
2077:	      2.9.2.3 -  The following static Math methods—including what they do and when 
2078:	                 they are used—are part of the Java Quick Reference: (A) int abs(int x) — Returns 
2079:	                 the absolute value of an int value (B) double abs(double x) — Returns the 
2080:	                 absolute value of a double value (C) double pow(double base, double exponent) 
2081:	                 — Returns the value of the first parameter raised to the power of the second 
2082:	                 parameter (D) double sqrt(double x) — Returns the positive square root of 
2083:	                 a double value (E) double random() — Returns a double value greater than or 
2084:	                 equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0 
2085:	      2.9.2.4 -  The values returned from Math.random can be manipulated to produce 
2086:	                 a random int or double in a defined range 
2087:	The "Math" class is part of the java.lang package and has built-in static methods that can 
2088:	be called. Useful methods include: abs, pow, sqrt, and random. Including manipulating the 
2089:	random method in a formula to define random numbers in a range. Examples of this follow...
2090:	// Examples of the Math class methods and randoms...
2091:	int    value1 = Math.abs(-1);
2092:	double value2 = Math.abs(-1.2);
2093:	double value3 = Math.pow(2,3);
2094:	double value4 = Math.sqrt(9);

2099:	Unit 5 - Writing Classes...................................................................
2100:	5.1 - Anatomy of a Class  .................................................................
2101:	   5.1.1 - Designate access and visibility constraints to classes, data, constructors, 
2102:	              and methods
2103:	      5.1.1.1 - The keywords public and private affect the access of  classes, data, 
2104:	                  constructors, and methods 
2105:	      5.1.1.2 - The keyword private restricts access to the declaring class, while 
2106:	                 the keyword public allows access from classes outside the declaring class 
2107:	      5.1.1.3 - Classes are designated public 
2108:	      5.1.1.4 - Access to attributes should be kept internal to the class. Therefore, 
2109:	                 instance variables are designated  as private 
2110:	      5.1.1.5 - Constructors are designated public 
2111:	      5.1.1.6 - Access to behaviors can be internal or external to the class. Therefore, 
2112:	                 methods can be designated as either public or private 
2113:	   5.1.2 - Designate private visibility of instance variables to encapsulate the 
2114:	              attributes of an object
2115:	      5.1.2.1 - Data encapsulation is a technique in which the implementation details 
2116:	                 of a class are kept hidden from the user 
2117:	      5.1.2.2 - When designing a class, programmers make decisions about what data 
2118:	                 to make accessible and modifiable from an external class. Data can be either 
2119:	                 accessible or modifiable, or it can be both or neither 
2120:	      5.1.2.3 - Instance variables are encapsulated by using the private access 
2121:	                 modifier 
2122:	      5.1.2.4 - The provided accessor and mutator methods in a class allow client 
2123:	                 code to use and modify data 
2124:	The properties (attributes) and methods (actions) of a class can be defined in terms of 
2125:	visibility. This means that the keywords "public" and "private" can be used as a 
2126:	modifier in the front of a method signature or at the front of a property declaration line 
2127:	to define the encapsulation level. The public keyword means the property can be accessed (and 
2128:	modified) both inside the class and from other classes outside the class. In terms of methods 
2129:	it means the method can be called within the class (by other methods) and outside the class 
2130:	from other classes using the dot "." operator. Classes and constructor methods are 
2131:	designated public. The concept of "encapsulation" is used to make certain data and actions 
2132:	private and protect them from outside classes and perhaps only allow access through accessor 
2133:	and modifier ("getter" and "setter") methods.
2134:	// Class example private/public properties and methods
2135:	class Apple { 
2136:	    public int number;
2137:	    private double price;
2138:	    public void eat() {
2139:	        // logic here
2140:	    }
2141:	    private void spoil() {
2142:	        // logic here
2143:	    }
2144:	}
2145:	5.2 - Constructors  .......................................................................
2146:	   5.2.1 - Define instance variables for the attributes to be initialized through 
2147:	              the constructors of a class
2148:	      5.2.1.1 - An object’s state refers to its attributes and their values at a 
2149:	                 given time and is defined by instance variables belonging to the object. This 
2150:	                 creates a  "has-a" relationship between the object and its instance variables 
2151:	      5.2.1.2 - Constructors are used to set the initial state of an object, which 
2152:	                 should include initial values for all instance variables 
2153:	      5.2.1.3 - Constructor parameters are local variables to the constructor and 
2154:	                 provide data to initialize instance variables 
2155:	      5.2.1.4 - When a mutable object is a constructor parameter, the instance variable 
2156:	                 should be initialized with a copy of the referenced object. In this way, the 
2157:	                 instance variable is not an alias of the original object, and methods are 
2158:	                 prevented from modifying the state of the original object 
2159:	      5.2.1.5 - When no constructor is written, Java provides a no-argument constructor, 
2160:	                 and the instance variables are set to default values 
2161:	A constructor method is a special method defined in a class that is called when a class is 
2162:	instantiated into an instance (or "object") of that class. The constructor method has to have 
2163:	the exact same name as the class (including letter case) and no return type (not even the 
2164:	word void). Constructors are usually used to set the initial (or "default") values for the 
2165:	class properties. This can be said to be setting the "state" of the object. If any of the 
2166:	properties (attributes) are another class level instance variable (not a primitive type), 
2167:	then this class is said to have a "has-a" relationship with that class. This can also be 
2168:	called "association" or "composition" between the classes. Constructors can have 
2169:	parameters passed to the class that can be used in setting the initial state. When no 
2170:	constructor is written, Java provides a no-argument constructor, and the instance 
2171:	variables are set to default values.
2172:	// Class example association and constructors
2173:	class Basket {
2174:	    public Apple apple;
2175:	    public Basket() {
2176:	        // logic here
2177:	    }
2178:	    public Basket(Apple apple) {
2179:	        // logic here
2180:	    }
2181:	}
2182:	5.3 - Documentation with Comments  ........................................................
2183:	   5.3.1 - Describe the functionality and use of program code through comments
2184:	      5.3.1.1 - Comments are ignored by the compiler and are not executed when the 
2185:	                 program is run 
2186:	      5.3.1.2 - Three types of comments in Java include /* */, which generates a 
2187:	                 block of comments, //, which generates a comment on one line, and /** */, 
2188:	                 which are Javadoc comments and are used to create API documentation 
2189:	      5.3.1.3 - A precondition is a condition that must be true just prior to the 
2190:	                 execution of a section of program code in order for the method to behave as 
2191:	                 expected. There is no expectation that the method will check to ensure preconditions 
2192:	                 are satisfied 
2193:	      5.3.1.4 - A postcondition is a condition that must always be true after the 
2194:	                 execution of a section of program code. Postconditions describe the outcome 
2195:	                 of the execution in terms of what is being returned or the state of an object 
2196:	      5.3.1.5 - Programmers write method code to satisfy the postconditions when 
2197:	                 preconditions are met 
2198:	Comments are a documentation system that allows programmers to leave notes for themselves or 
2199:	other programmers. This can serve several purposes including (but not limited to) 
2200:	documenting names and dates, explaining code logic, working through problem solving logic, 
2201:	and others. In Java, the two forward slashes // allows a comment at the end of a line of code or 
2202:	on its own line. A slash and a star /* opens a comment block which will continue until a star 
2203:	and slash */ closes the comment block. The slash and two stars /** open the JavaDoc style of 
2204:	comment block which many IDEs (e.g. NetBeans) recognize and help with commenting and to create 
2205:	API documentation. Methods should be commented with the method's purpose (a brief description), 
2206:	any pre-conditions (the parameters if any), and post-conditions (the return type if any) of the 
2207:	method.

2212:	5.4 - Accessor Methods  ...................................................................
2213:	   5.4.1 - Define behaviors of an object through non-void methods without parameters 
2214:	              written in a class
2215:	      5.4.1.1 - An accessor method allows other objects to obtain the  value of 
2216:	                 instance variables or static variables 
2217:	      5.4.1.2 - A non-void method returns a single value. Its header includes the 
2218:	                 return type in place of the keyword void 
2219:	      5.4.1.3 - In non-void methods, a return expression compatible with the return 
2220:	                 type is evaluated, and a copy of that value is returned. This is referred 
2221:	                 to as "return by  value."  
2222:	      5.4.1.4 - When the return expression is a reference to an object, a copy of 
2223:	                 that reference is returned, not a copy of the object 
2224:	      5.4.1.5 - The return keyword is used to return the flow of control to the 
2225:	                 point immediately following where the method or constructor was called 
2226:	      5.4.1.6 - The toString method is an overridden method that is included in 
2227:	                 classes to provide a description of a specific object. It generally includes 
2228:	                 what values are stored in the instance data of the object 
2229:	      5.4.1.7 - If System.out.print or System.out.println is passed an object, that 
2230:	                 object’s toString method is called, and the returned string is printed 
2231:	Accessor methods are the names given to methods in a class that "access" data. this usually 
2232:	means properties of the class that are encapsulated (private). Other names for 
2233:	accessors are "getters" or "get" methods. The method (behaviours, actions, functions, 
2234:	procedures) of a class are accessed with the dot operator (".") after the name of the 
2235:	object (instance of the class). Non-void methods that return a value can then be used as 
2236:	part of a code line expression. The return type of the method must be compatible with any 
2237:	data types (e.g. variables) being used in the expression. If the return type is a class level 
2238:	type then the method returns a reference to the actual object ("return by reference") not a 
2239:	reference to a copy ("return by value") of the actual object. If the "System.out.print" 
2240:	or "System.out.println" methods are called and an object is passed to those methods, the 
2241:	object's "toString()" method is automatically 
2242:	invoked (called) in the output.
2243:	// Examples of calling methods in a class
2244:	class Fighter {
2245:	    private int health;
2246:	    private Weapon weapon;
2247:	    public int getHealth() {
2248:	        return health;
2249:	    }
2250:	    public Weapon getWeapon() {
2251:	        return weapon;

2253:	}
2254:	Fighter fighter = new Fighter();
2255:	int hp = fighter.health;
2256:	Weapon club = fighter.getWeapon();
2257:	5.5 - Mutator Methods  ....................................................................
2258:	   5.5.1 - Define behaviors of an object through void methods with or without parameters 
2259:	              written in a class
2260:	      5.5.1.1 - A void method does not return a value. Its header contains the keyword 
2261:	                 void before the method name 
2262:	      5.5.1.2 - A mutator (modifier) method is often a void method that changes 
2263:	                 the values of instance variables or static variables 
2264:	Mutator methods are the name given to methods that "change" a property of a class (usually 
2265:	an encapsulated property). These can be void methods (but are sometimes boolean methods to 
2266:	indicate success or not).
2267:	// Examples of calling mutator methods in a class
2268:	class Fighter {
2269:	    private int health;
2270:	    public int setHealth(int health) {
2271:	        this.health = health;
2272:	    }
2273:	}
2274:	Fighter fighter = new Fighter();
2275:	fighter.setHealth(10);
2276:	5.6 - Writing Methods  ....................................................................
2277:	   5.6.1 - Define behaviors of an object through non-void methods with parameters 
2278:	              written in a class
2279:	      5.6.1.1 - Methods can only access the private data and methods of a parameter 
2280:	                 that is a reference to an object when the parameter is the same type as the 
2281:	                 method’s enclosing class 
2282:	      5.6.1.2 - Non-void methods with parameters receive values through parameters, 
2283:	                 use those values, and return a computed value of the specified type 
2284:	      5.6.1.3 - It is good programming practice to not modify mutable objects that 
2285:	                 are passed as parameters unless required in the specification 
2286:	      5.6.1.4 - When an actual parameter is a primitive value, the formal parameter 
2287:	                 is initialized with a copy of that value. Changes to the formal parameter 
2288:	                 have no effect on the corresponding actual parameter 
2289:	      5.6.1.5 - When an actual parameter is a reference to an object, the formal 
2290:	                 parameter is initialized with a copy of that reference, not a copy of the 
2291:	                 object. If the reference is to a mutable object, the method or constructor 
2292:	                 can use this reference to alter the state of the object 
2293:	      5.6.1.6 - Passing a reference parameter results in the formal parameter and 
2294:	                 the actual parameter being aliases. They both refer to the same object 
2295:	Methods are written to model an "action". Also known as functions or procedures, methods may 
2296:	or may not have zero, one, or more than one "input(s)" called "parameters" (or empty round 
2297:	brackets if no inputs are required). Methods may have zero (a "void" method) or one "output" 
2298:	known as the return type. If the parameter is a primitive data type, then a copy of the data 
2299:	from the original primitive type is passed to the method ("pass by value"). If the parameter 
2300:	is an advanced data type ("class" level data) then a reference to that object is passed. This 
2301:	means that any changes the method makes to the object will be reflected (unless the object 
2302:	was an immutable object). Because the passed reference object parameter and the original 
2303:	argument object are "linked" they can be referred to as "aliases".
2304:	5.7 - Static Variables and Methods  .......................................................
2305:	   5.7.1 - Define behaviors of a class through static methods
2306:	      5.7.1.1 - Static methods are associated with the class, not objects of the 
2307:	                 class 
2308:	      5.7.1.2 - Static methods include the keyword static in the header before the 
2309:	                 method name 
2310:	      5.7.1.3 - Static methods cannot access or change the values of instance variables 
2311:	      5.7.1.4 - Static methods can access or change the values of static variables 
2312:	      5.7.1.5 - Static methods do not have a this reference and are unable to use 
2313:	                 the class’s instance variables or call non-static methods 
2314:	   5.7.2 - Define the static variables that belong to the class 
2315:	      5.7.2.1 - Static variables belong to the class, with all objects of a class 
2316:	                 sharing a single static variable 
2317:	      5.7.2.2 - Static variables can be designated as either public or private and 
2318:	                 are designated with the static keyword before the variable type 
2319:	      5.7.2.3 - Static variables are used with the class name and the dot operator, 
2320:	                 since they are associated with a class, not objects of a class 
2321:	Although they can be called from an object of a class, "static" methods are generally called 
2322:	from the class name itself. Static methods "belong" to the class itself and therefore 
2323:	do not require you to instantiate an object to call a method from that class. The keyword 
2324:	"static" is included as a modifier word in the method signature line. Static methods 
2325:	cannot access or change the values of instance properties of a class but can change/access 
2326:	static properties. Static properties (variables) also "belong" to the class itself 
2327:	and are "shared" by all objects of the class. Static properties can be either public or 
2328:	private and are also declared using the "static" keyword as a modifier for the 
2329:	property. Static properties are used with the class name and then the dot operator and then 
2330:	the name of the property (although they can also be accessed from an object name). 
2331:	// Static properties and methods
2332:	class Fighter {
2333:	    public static int number;
2334:	    public static void attack() {
2335:	        // logic here
2336:	    }
2337:	}
2338:	Fighter.number = 10;
2339:	Fighter.attack();
2340:	5.8 - Scope and Access  ...................................................................
2341:	   5.8.1 - Explain where variables can be used in the program code
2342:	      5.8.1.1 - Local variables can be declared in the body of constructors and 
2343:	                 methods. These variables may only be used within the constructor or method 
2344:	                 and cannot be declared to be public or private 
2345:	      5.8.1.2 - When there is a local variable with the same name as an instance 
2346:	                 variable, the variable name will refer to the local variable instead of the 
2347:	                 instance variable 
2348:	      5.8.1.3 - Formal parameters and variables declared in a method or constructor 
2349:	                 can only be used within that method or constructor 
2350:	      5.8.1.4 - Through method decomposition, a programmer breaks down a large problem 
2351:	                 into smaller subproblems by creating methods to solve each individual subproblem 
2352:	Variables can be used throughout code in classes and methods and have a "scope" defining where 
2353:	the variable can be accessed and modified. A "local" variable is one which is defined in a 
2354:	code block like a control structure (a loop or if statement) or a method. The scope of that 
2355:	variable is that internal code block and no other variables can have the same name within 
2356:	that scope. A "global" variable is one declared at the class level and its scope is 
2357:	the entire code module (class). When there is a local variable with the same name as a global 
2358:	variable, the variable name will reference the local variable over the global variable. This 
2359:	could be a potential name conflict. The keyword "this" with the dot operator can make an 
2360:	explicit reference to the global variable over the local variable. 
2361:	// Local and global variable scopes
2362:	class Fighter {
2363:	    public int number;
2364:	    public void attack(int number) {
2365:	        this.number = number;
2366:	    }
2367:	}
2368:	5.9 - this Keyword  .......................................................................
2369:	   5.9.1 - Evaluate object reference expressions that use the keyword this
2370:	      5.9.1.1 - Within a non-static method or a constructor, the keyword this is 
2371:	                 a reference to the current object the object whose method or constructor is 
2372:	                 being called 
2373:	      5.9.1.2 - The keyword this can be used to pass the current object as an actual 
2374:	                 parameter in a method call 
2375:	The keyword "this" is an explicit reference to the (eventual) object within a class. It 
2376:	refers to the name of an object that will later be instantiated by the class the word this 
2377:	is used within. The word "this" can be used to give explicit control to a global variable 
2378:	or call a class method. The keyword "this" can also be used to pass the current object 
2379:	as an actual parameter in a method call.
2380:	5.10 - Ethical and Social Implications of Computing Systems  ..............................
2381:	   5.10.1 - Explain the ethical and social implications of computing systems
2382:	      5.10.1.1 - System reliability is limited. Programmers should make an effort 
2383:	                 to maximize system reliability 
2384:	      5.10.1.2 - Legal issues and intellectual property concerns arise when creating 
2385:	                 programs 
2386:	      5.10.1.3 - The creation of programs has impacts on society, economies, and 
2387:	                 culture. These impacts can be beneficial and/or harmful 
2388:	The social and ethical considerations of computing and Computer Science are things as 
2389:	an A.P. student you should be aware of. These are not necessarily testable concepts on the 
2390:	A.P. exam. The general ideas of legality, impact, and reliability of computing systems 
2391:	and software should always be considered by programers and Computer Scientists.
2392:	Unit 9 - Inheritance           ............................................................
2393:	9.1 - Creating Superclasses and Subclasses  ...............................................
2394:	   9.1.1 -  Create an inheritance relationship from a subclass to the superclass
2395:	      9.1.1.1 - A class hierarchy can be developed by putting common attributes 
2396:	                 and behaviors of related classes into a single class called a superclass 
2397:	      9.1.1.2 - Classes that extend a superclass, called subclasses, can draw upon 
2398:	                 the existing attributes and behaviors  of the superclass without repeating 
2399:	                 these in the code 
2400:	      9.1.1.3 - Extending a subclass from a superclass creates an "is-a" relationship 
2401:	                 from the subclass to the superclass 
2402:	      9.1.1.4 - The keyword extends is used to establish an inheritance relationship 
2403:	                 between a subclass and a superclass. A class can extend only one superclass 
2404:	Add your own example(s) here...
2405:	9.2 - Writing Constructors for Subclasses..................................................
2406:	   9.2.1- Create an inheritance relationship from a subclass to the Superclass
2407:	      9.2.1.1 - Constructors are not inherited 
2408:	      9.2.1.2 - The superclass constructor can be called from the first line of 
2409:	                 a subclass constructor by using the keyword super and passing appropriate 
2410:	                 parameters 
2411:	      9.2.1.3 - The actual parameters passed in the call to the superclass constructor 
2412:	                 provide values that the constructor can use to initialize the object’s instance 
2413:	                 variables 
2414:	      9.2.1.4 - When a subclass’s constructor does not explicitly call a superclass’s 
2415:	                 constructor using super, Java inserts a call to the superclass’s no-argument 
2416:	                 constructor
2417:	      9.2.1.5 - Regardless of whether the superclass constructor is called implicitly 
2418:	                 or explicitly, the process of calling superclass constructors continues until 
2419:	                 the Object constructor is called. At this  point, all of the constructors 
2420:	                 within the hierarchy execute beginning with the Object constructor 
2421:	Add your own example(s) here...
2422:	9.3 - Overriding Methods  .................................................................
2423:	   9.3.1 - Create an inheritance relationship from a subclass to the Superclass
2424:	      9.3.1.1 - Method overriding occurs when a public method in a subclass has 
2425:	                 the same method signature as a public method in the superclass 
2426:	      9.3.1.2 - Any method that is called must be defined within its own class or 
2427:	                 its superclass 
2428:	      9.3.1.3 - A subclass is usually designed to have modified (overridden) or 
2429:	                 additional methods or instance Variables 
2430:	      9.3.1.4 - A subclass will inherit all public methods from the superclass; 
2431:	                 these methods remain public in the subclass 
2432:	Add your own example(s) here...
2433:	9.4 - super Keyword  ......................................................................
2434:	   9.4.1 - Create an inheritance relationship from a subclass to the superclass
2435:	      9.4.1.1 - The keyword super can be used to call a superclass's constructors

2437:	      9.4.1.2 - The superclass method can be called in a subclass by using the keyword 
2438:	                 super with the method name and passing appropriate parameters 
2439:	Add your own example(s) here...
2440:	9.5 - Creating References Using Inheritance Hierarchies  ..................................
2441:	   9.5.1 - Define reference variables of a superclass to be assigned to an object 
2442:	              of a subclass in the same hierarchy
2443:	      9.5.1.1 - When a class S “is-a” class T, T is referred to as a superclass, 
2444:	                 and S is referred to as a subclass 
2445:	      9.5.1.2 - If S is a subclass of T, then assigning an object of type S to a 
2446:	                 reference of type T facilitates Polymorphism 
2447:	      9.5.1.3 - If S is a subclass of T, then a reference of type T can be used 
2448:	                 to refer to an object of type T or S 
2449:	      9.5.1.4 - Declaring references of type T, when S is a subclass of T, is useful 
2450:	                 in the following declarations: (a) Formal method parameters, (b) arrays —

2455:	      9.6.1.1 - Utilize the Object class through inheritance
2456:	      9.6.1.2 - At compile time, methods in or inherited by the declared type determine 
2457:	                 the correctness of a non-static method call 
2458:	      9.6.1.3 - At run-time, the method in the actual object type is executed for

2474:	   6.1.1 - Represent collections of related primitive or object reference data using 
2475:	              one dimensional (1D - array objects)
2476:	      6.1.1.1 - The use of array objects allows multiple related items to be represented 
2477:	                 using a single variable 
2478:	      6.1.1.2 - The size of an array is established at the time of creation and 
2479:	                 cannot be changed 
2480:	      6.1.1.3 - Arrays can store either primitive data or object reference data 
2481:	      6.1.1.4 - When an array is created using the keyword new, all of its elements 
2482:	                 are initialized with a specific value based on the type of  elements: (a) 
2483:	                 Elements of type int are initialized to 0, (b) Elements of type double are 
2484:	                 initialized to 0.0, (c) Elements of type boolean are initialized to false, 
2485:	                 (d) Elements of a reference type are initialized to the reference value null. 
2486:	                 No objects are automatically created 
2487:	      6.1.1.5 - Initializer lists can be used to create and initialize arrays 
2488:	      6.1.1.6 - Square brackets [ ] are used to access and modify an element in 
2489:	                 a 1D array using an index 
2490:	      6.1.1.7 - The valid index values for an array are 0 through one less than 
2491:	                 the number of elements in the array, inclusive. Using an index value outside 
2492:	                 of this range will result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException being thrown 
2493:	Add your own example(s) here...
2494:	6.2 - Traversing Arrays  ..................................................................
2495:	   6.2.1 - Traverse the elements in a 1D array
2496:	      6.2.1.1 - Iteration statements can be used to access all the elements in an 
2497:	                 array. This is called traversing the array 
2498:	      6.2.1.2 - Traversing an array with an indexed for loop or while loop requires 
2499:	                 elements to be accessed using their indices 
2500:	      6.2.1.3 - Since the indices for an array start at 0 and end at the number 
2501:	                 of elements − 1, “off by one” errors are easy to make when traversing an array, 
2502:	                 resulting in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException being thrown 
2503:	Add your own example(s) here...
2504:	6.3 - Enhanced for Loop for Arrays  .......................................................

2506:	      6.3.1.1 - An enhanced for loop header includes a variable, referred to as 
2507:	                 the enhanced for loop variable 
2508:	      6.3.1.2 - For each iteration of the enhanced for loop, the enhanced for loop 
2509:	                 variable is assigned a copy of an element without using its index 
2510:	      6.3.1.3 - Assigning a new value to the enhanced for loop variable does not 
2511:	                 change the value stored in the array 
2512:	      6.3.1.4 - Program code written using an enhanced for loop to traverse and 
2513:	                 access elements in an array can be rewritten using an indexed for loop or 
2514:	                 a while loop

2517:	   6.4.1 - For algorithms in the context of a particular specification that requires 
2518:	              the use of array traversals: (a) Identify standard algorithms, (b) Modify standard 
2519:	              algorithms, (c) Develop an algorithm
2520:	      6.4.1.1 - There are standard algorithms that utilize array traversals to: 
2521:	                 (a) Determine a minimum or maximum value, (b) Compute a sum, average, or mode,

2530:	8.1 - 2D Arrays  ..........................................................................
2531:	   8.1.1 - Represent collections of related primitive or object reference data using 
2532:	              two-dimensional (2D) array objects
2533:	      8.1.1.1 - 2D arrays are stored as arrays of arrays. Therefore, the way 2D 
2534:	                 arrays are created and indexed is similar to 1D array objects 
2535:	      8.1.1.2 - For the purposes of the exam, when accessing the element at arr[first][second], 
2536:	                 the first index is used for rows, the second index is used for columns 
2537:	      8.1.1.3 - The initializer list used to create and initialize a 2D array consists 
2538:	                 of initializer lists that represent 1D arrays 
2539:	      8.1.1.4 - The square brackets [row][col] are used to access and modify an 
2540:	                 element in a 2D array 
2541:	      8.1.1.5 - “Row-major order” refers to an ordering of 2D array elements where 
2542:	                 traversal occurs across each row, while “column-major order” traversal occurs 
2543:	                 down each column 
2544:	Add your own example(s) here...
2545:	8.2 - Traversing 2D Arrays  ...............................................................
2546:	   8.2.1 - For 2D array objects: (a) Traverse using nested for loops, (b) Traverse 
2547:	              using nested enhanced for loops
2548:	      8.2.1.1 - Nested iteration statements can be written to traverse the 2D array 
2549:	                 in “row-major order” or “column-major Order.” 
2550:	      8.2.1.2 - The outer loop of a nested enhanced for loop used to traverse a 
2551:	                 2D array traverses the rows. Therefore, the enhanced for loop variable must 
2552:	                 be the type of each row, which is a 1D array. The inner loop traverses a single 
2553:	                 row.  Therefore, the inner enhanced for loop variable must be the same type 
2554:	                 as the elements stored in the 1D array

2558:	7.1 - Introduction to ArrayList  ..........................................................
2559:	   7.1.1 - Represent collections of related object reference data using ArrayList 
2560:	              objects
2561:	      7.1.1.1 - An ArrayList object is mutable and contains object references
2562:	      7.1.1.2 - The ArrayList constructor ArrayList() constructs an empty list 
2563:	      7.1.1.3 - Java allows the generic type ArrayList<E>, where the generic type 
2564:	                 E specifies the type of the elements 
2565:	      7.1.1.4 - When ArrayList<E> is specified, the types of the reference parameters 
2566:	                 and return type when using the methods are type E 
2567:	      7.1.1.5 - ArrayList<E> is preferred over ArrayList because it allows the compiler 
2568:	                 to find errors that would otherwise be found at run-time 
2569:	Add your own example(s) here...
2570:	7.2 - ArrayList Methods  ..................................................................
2571:	   7.2.1 - Represent collections of related object reference data using ArrayList 
2572:	              objects
2573:	      7.2.1.1 - The ArrayList class is part of the java.util package.  An import 
2574:	                 statement can be used to make this class available for use in the program 
2575:	      7.2.1.2 - The following ArrayList methods—including what they do and when 
2576:	                 they are used—are part of the Java Quick Reference: (a) int size() - Returns 
2577:	                 the number of elements in the list, (b) boolean add(E obj) - Appends obj to 
2578:	                 end of list; returns true, (c) void add(int index, E obj) - Inserts obj at 
2579:	                 position index (0 <= index <= size), moving elements at position index and 
2580:	                 higher to the right (adds 1 to their indices) and adds 1 to size, (d) E get(int 
2581:	                 index) - Returns the element at position index in the list, (e) E set(int 
2582:	                 index, E obj) — Replaces the element at position index with obj; returns the 
2583:	                 element formerly at position index E remove(int index) — Removes element from 
2584:	                 position index, moving elements at position index + 1 and higher to the left 
2585:	                 (subtracts 1 from their indices) and subtracts 1 from  size;  returns the 
2586:	                 element formerly at position index 
2587:	Add your own example(s) here...
2588:	7.3 - Traversing ArrayLists  ..............................................................
2589:	   7.3.1 - For ArrayList objects: (a) Traverse using a for or while loop, (b) Traverse 
2590:	              using an enhanced for loop
2591:	      7.3.1.1 - Iteration statements can be used to access all the elements in an 
2592:	                 ArrayList. This is called traversing the ArrayList 
2593:	      7.3.1.2 - Deleting elements during a traversal of an ArrayList requires using 
2594:	                 special techniques to avoid skipping elements 
2595:	      7.3.1.3 - Since the indices for an ArrayList start at 0 and end at the number 
2596:	                 of elements − 1, accessing an index value outside of this range will result 
2597:	                 in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException being thrown 
2598:	      7.3.1.4 - Changing the size of an ArrayList while traversing it using an enhanced 
2599:	                 for loop can result in a ConcurrentModificationException being thrown. Therefore, 
2600:	                 when using an enhanced for loop to traverse an ArrayList, you should not add 
2601:	                 or remove elements 
2602:	Add your own example(s) here...
2603:	7.4 - Developing Algorithms Using ArrayLists  .............................................

2609:	                 algorithms that are used with 1D arrays 
2610:	      7.4.1.2 - Some algorithms require multiple String, array, or ArrayList objects 
2611:	                 to be traversed simultaneously
2612:	Add your own example(s) here...
2613:	7.5 - Searching  ..........................................................................

2641:	   10.1.1 - Determine the result of executing recursive methods
2642:	      10.1.1.1 - A recursive method is a method that calls itself 
2643:	      10.1.1.2 - Recursive methods contain at least one base case, which halts the 
2644:	                 recursion, and at least one recursive call 
2645:	      10.1.1.3 - Each recursive call has its own set of local variables, including 
2646:	                 the formal parameters 
2647:	      10.1.1.4 - Parameter values capture the progress of a recursive process, much 
2648:	                 like loop control variable values capture the progress of a loop 
2649:	      10.1.1.5 - Any recursive solution can be replicated through the use of an 
2650:	                 iterative approach

2656:	              or ArrayList objects
2657:	      10.2.1.1 - Data must be in sorted order to use the binary search algorithm 
2658:	      10.2.1.2 - The binary search algorithm starts at the middle of a sorted array 
2659:	                 or ArrayList and eliminates half of the array or ArrayList in each iteration 
2660:	                 until the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated 
2661:	      10.2.1.3 - Binary search can be more efficient than sequential/linear search 
2662:	      10.2.1.4 - The binary search algorithm can be written either iteratively or

3061:	A travel agency maintains a list of information 
3062:	about airline flights. Flight information 
3063:	includes a departure time and an arrival time.
3064:	You may assume that the two times occur on the 
3065:	same day. These times are represented by 
3066:	objects of the Time class. The declaration for
3067:	the Time class is shown below. It includes a 
3068:	method which returns the difference (in minutes)
3069:	between the current Time object and another Time
3070:	object.

3083:	For example, assume that t1 and t2 are Time 
3084:	objects where t1 represents 1:00 p.m. and t2 
3085:	represents 2:15 p.m. The call t1.minutesUntil(t2) 
3086:	will return 75 and the call t2.minutesUntil(t1) 
3087:	will return -75. The declaration for the Flight class 
3088:	is shown below. It has methods to access the 
3089:	departure time and the arrival time of a flight. 
3090:	You may assume that the departure time of a 
3091:	flight is earlier than its arrival time.

3109:	the departure time of the flight is later than 
3110:	the arrival time of the preceding flight in the
