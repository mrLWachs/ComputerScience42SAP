1.1.1.1 - System.out.print and System.out.println display information on the computer monitor 
1.1.1.2 - System.out.println moves the cursor to a new line after  the information has been displayed, while System.out.print does not     
1.1.2 - Create string literals
1.1.2.1 - A string literal is enclosed in double quotes     
1.2 - Variables and Data Types
1.2.1 - Identify the most appropriate data type category for a particular specification
1.2.1.1 - A type is a set of values (a domain) and a set of operations on them 
1.2.1.2 - Data types can be categorized as either primitive or reference 
1.2.1.3 - The primitive data types used in this course define the set of operations for numbers and Boolean values 
1.2.1 - Declare variables of the correct types to represent primitive data
1.2.1.1 - The three primitive data types used in this course are int, double, and boolean 
1.2.1.2 - Each variable has associated memory that is used to hold its value 
1.2.1.3 - The memory associated with a variable of a primitive type holds an actual primitive value

1.3.2 - Evaluate what is stored in a variable as a result of an expression with an assignment statement
1.3.2.1 - The assignment operator (=) allows a program to initialize or change the value stored in a variable. The value of the expression on the right is stored in the variable on the left 
1.3.2.2 - During execution, expressions are evaluated to produce a single value 
1.3.2.3 - The value of an expression has a type based on the evaluation of the expression

1.5.1.1 - The casting operators (int) and (double) can be used to create a temporary value converted to a different data type
1.5.1.2 - Casting a double value to an int causes the digits to the right of the decimal point to be truncated
1.5.1.3 - Some programming code causes int values to be automatically cast (widened) to double values
1.5.1.4 - Values of type double can be rounded to the nearest integer by (int)(x + 0.5) or (int)(x – 0.5) for negative numbers 
1.5.1.5 - Integer values in Java are represented by values of type int, which are stored using a finite amount (4 bytes) of memory. Therefore, an int value must be in the range from Integer.MIN_VALUE to Integer.MAX_VALUE inclusive
1.5.1.6 - If an expression would evaluate to an int value outside of the allowed range, an integer overflow occurs. This could result in an incorrect value within the allowed range 
Unit 2 - Using Objects
2.1 - Objects: Instances of Classes
2.1.1 - Explain the relationship between a class and an object
2.1.1.1 - An object is a specific instance of a class with defined attributes 
2.1.1.2 - A class is the formal implementation, or blueprint, of the attributes and behaviors of an object 
2.2 - Creating and Storing Objects (Instantiation)
2.2.1 - Identify, using its signature, the correct constructor being called
2.2.1.1 - A signature consists of the constructor name and the parameter list

2.2.1.3 - A parameter is a value that is passed into a constructor. These are often referred to as actual parameters 
2.2.1.4 - Constructors are said to be overloaded when there are multiple constructors with the same name but a different signature 
2.2.1.5 - The actual parameters passed to a constructor must be compatible with the types identified in the formal parameter list 
2.2.1.6 - Parameters are passed using call by value. Call by  value initializes the formal parameters with copies of the actual parameters

2.2.3 - Define variables of the correct types to represent reference data
2.2.3.1 - The keyword null is a special value used to indicate that a reference is not associated with any object 
2.2.3.2 - The memory associated with a variable of a reference type holds an object reference value or, if there is no object, null. This value is the memory address of the referenced object

2.3.1.2 -  Procedural abstraction allows a programmer to use a method by knowing what the method does even if they do not know how the method was written 
2.3.1.3 -  A method signature for a method without parameters consists of the method name and an empty parameter list
2.3.1.4 -  A method or constructor call interrupts the sequential execution of statements, causing the program to first execute the statements in the method or constructor before continuing. Once the last statement in the method or constructor has executed or a return statement is executed, flow of control is returned to the point immediately following where the method or constructor was called 
2.3.1.5 -  Non-static methods are called through objects of the Class 
2.3.1.6 -  The dot operator is used along with the object name to call non-static methods 
2.3.1.7 -  Void methods do not have return values and are therefore not called as part of an expression 
2.3.1.8 -  Using a null reference to call a method or access an instance variable causes a NullPointerException to be thrown 
2.4 - Calling a Void Method with Parameters 
2.4.1 -  Call non-static void methods with parameters

3.2.1.1 -  Conditional statements interrupt the sequential execution of statements 
3.2.1.2 -  if statements affect the flow of control by executing different statements based on the value of a Boolean Expression 
3.2.1.3 -  A one-way selection (if statement) is written when there is a set of statements to execute under a certain condition. In this case, the body is executed only when the Boolean condition is true 
3.3 - if-else Statements  
3.3.1 -  Represent branching logical processes by using conditional Statements

Unit 4 - Iteration
4.1 - while Loops  
4.1.1 - Represent iterative processes using a while loop
4.1.1.1 - Iteration statements change the flow of control by repeating a set of statements zero or more times until a condition is met 
4.1.1.2 - In loops, the Boolean expression is evaluated before each iteration of the loop body, including the first. When the expression evaluates to true, the loop body is executed. This continues until the expression evaluates to false, whereupon the iteration ceases 4.1.1.3 - A loop is an infinite loop when the Boolean expression always evaluates to true 
4.1.1.4 - If the Boolean expression evaluates to false initially, the loop body is not executed at all

4.2.1.2 - In a for loop, the initialization statement is only executed once before the first Boolean expression evaluation. The variable being initialized is referred to as a loop control variable 
4.2.1.3 - In each iteration of a for loop, the increment statement is executed after the entire loop body is executed and before the Boolean expression is evaluated again

Unit 5 - Writing Classes
5.1 - Anatomy of a Class  
5.1.1 - Designate access and visibility constraints to classes, data, constructors, and methods
5.1.1.1 - The keywords public and private affect the access of  classes, data,  constructors, and methods 
5.1.1.2 - The keyword private restricts access to the declaring class, while the keyword public allows access from classes outside the declaring class 
5.1.1.3 - Classes are designated public 
5.1.1.4 - Access to attributes should be kept internal to the class. Therefore, instance variables are designated  as private 
5.1.1.5 - Constructors are designated public 
5.1.1.6 - Access to behaviors can be internal or external to the class. Therefore, methods can be designated as either public or private 
5.1.2 - Designate private visibility of instance variables to encapsulate the attributes of an object
5.1.2.1 - Data encapsulation is a technique in which the implementation details of a class are kept hidden from the user 
5.1.2.2 - When designing a class, programmers make decisions about what data to make accessible and modifiable from an external class. Data can be either accessible or modifiable, or it can be both or neither 
5.1.2.3 - Instance variables are encapsulated by using the private access modifier 
5.1.2.4 - The provided accessor and mutator methods in a class allow client code to use and modify data 
5.2 - Constructors  
5.2.1 - Define instance variables for the attributes to be initialized through the constructors of a class
5.2.1.1 - An object’s state refers to its attributes and their values at a given time and is defined by instance variables belonging to the object. This creates a  "has-a" relationship between the object and its instance variables 
5.2.1.2 - Constructors are used to set the initial state of an object, which should include initial values for all instance variables 
5.2.1.3 - Constructor parameters are local variables to the constructor and provide data to initialize instance variables 
5.2.1.4 - When a mutable object is a constructor parameter, the instance variable should be initialized with a copy of the referenced object. In this way, the instance variable is not an alias of the original object, and methods are prevented from modifying the state of the original object 
5.2.1.5 - When no constructor is written, Java provides a no-argument constructor, and the instance variables are set to default values 
5.3 - Documentation with Comments  
5.3.1 - Describe the functionality and use of program code through comments
5.3.1.1 - Comments are ignored by the compiler and are not executed when the program is run 
5.3.1.2 - Three types of comments in Java include /* */, which generates a block of comments, //, which generates a comment on one line, and /** */, which are Javadoc comments and are used to create API documentation 
5.3.1.3 - A precondition is a condition that must be true just prior to the execution of a section of program code in order for the method to behave as expected. There is no expectation that the method will check to ensure preconditions are satisfied 
5.3.1.4 - A postcondition is a condition that must always be true after the execution of a section of program code. Postconditions describe the outcome of the execution in terms of what is being returned or the state of an object 
5.3.1.5 - Programmers write method code to satisfy the postconditions when preconditions are met 
5.4 - Accessor Methods  
5.4.1 - Define behaviors of an object through non-void methods without parameters written in a class
5.4.1.1 - An accessor method allows other objects to obtain the  value of instance variables or static variables 
5.4.1.2 - A non-void method returns a single value. Its header includes the return type in place of the keyword void 
5.4.1.3 - In non-void methods, a return expression compatible with the return type is evaluated, and a copy of that value is returned. This is referred to as "return by  value."  
5.4.1.4 - When the return expression is a reference to an object, a copy of that reference is returned, not a copy of the object 
5.4.1.5 - The return keyword is used to return the flow of control to the point immediately following where the method or constructor was called 
5.4.1.6 - The toString method is an overridden method that is included in classes to provide a description of a specific object. It generally includes what values are stored in the instance data of the object 
5.4.1.7 - If System.out.print or System.out.println is passed an object, that object’s toString method is called, and the returned string is printed 
5.5 - Mutator Methods  
5.5.1 - Define behaviors of an object through void methods with or without parameters written in a class
5.5.1.1 - A void method does not return a value. Its header contains the keyword void before the method name 
5.5.1.2 - A mutator (modifier) method is often a void method that changes the values of instance variables or static variables 
5.6 - Writing Methods  
5.6.1 - Define behaviors of an object through non-void methods with parameters written in a class
5.6.1.1 - Methods can only access the private data and methods of a parameter that is a reference to an object when the parameter is the same type as the method’s enclosing class 
5.6.1.2 - Non-void methods with parameters receive values through parameters, use those values, and return a computed value of the specified type 
5.6.1.3 - It is good programming practice to not modify mutable objects that are passed as parameters unless required in the specification 
5.6.1.4 - When an actual parameter is a primitive value, the formal parameter is initialized with a copy of that value. Changes to the formal parameter have no effect on the corresponding actual parameter 
5.6.1.5 - When an actual parameter is a reference to an object, the formal parameter is initialized with a copy of that reference, not a copy of the object. If the reference is to a mutable object, the method or constructor can use this reference to alter the state of the object 
5.6.1.6 - Passing a reference parameter results in the formal parameter and the actual parameter being aliases. They both refer to the same object 
5.7 - Static Variables and Methods  
5.7.1 - Define behaviors of a class through static methods
5.7.1.1 - Static methods are associated with the class, not objects of the class 
5.7.1.2 - Static methods include the keyword static in the header before the method name 
5.7.1.3 - Static methods cannot access or change the values of instance variables 
5.7.1.4 - Static methods can access or change the values of static variables 
5.7.1.5 - Static methods do not have a this reference and are unable to use the class’s instance variables or call non-static methods 
5.7.2 - Define the static variables that belong to the class 
5.7.2.1 - Static variables belong to the class, with all objects of a class sharing a single static variable 
5.7.2.2 - Static variables can be designated as either public or private and are designated with the static keyword before the variable type 
5.7.2.3 - Static variables are used with the class name and the dot operator, since they are associated with a class, not objects of a class 
5.8 - Scope and Access  
5.8.1 - Explain where variables can be used in the program code
5.8.1.1 - Local variables can be declared in the body of constructors and methods. These variables may only be used within the constructor or method and cannot be declared to be public or private 
5.8.1.2 - When there is a local variable with the same name as an instance variable, the variable name will refer to the local variable instead of the instance variable 
5.8.1.3 - Formal parameters and variables declared in a method or constructor can only be used within that method or constructor 
5.8.1.4 - Through method decomposition, a programmer breaks down a large problem into smaller subproblems by creating methods to solve each individual subproblem 
5.9 - this Keyword  
5.9.1 - Evaluate object reference expressions that use the keyword this
5.9.1.1 - Within a non-static method or a constructor, the keyword this is a reference to the current object the object whose method or constructor is being called 
5.9.1.2 - The keyword this can be used to pass the current object as an actual parameter in a method call 
5.10 - Ethical and Social Implications of Computing Systems

6.1.1.3 - Arrays can store either primitive data or object reference data 
6.1.1.4 - When an array is created using the keyword new, all of its elements are initialized with a specific value based on the type of  elements: (a) Elements of type int are initialized to 0, (b) Elements of type double are initialized to 0.0, (c) Elements of type boolean are initialized to false, (d) Elements of a reference type are initialized to the reference value null. No objects are automatically created 
6.1.1.5 - Initializer lists can be used to create and initialize arrays 
6.1.1.6 - Square brackets [ ] are used to access and modify an element in a 1D array using an index 
6.1.1.7 - The valid index values for an array are 0 through one less than the number of elements in the array, inclusive. Using an index value outside of this range will result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException being thrown 
6.2 - Traversing Arrays  
6.2.1 - Traverse the elements in a 1D array
6.2.1.1 - Iteration statements can be used to access all the elements in an array. This is called traversing the array 
6.2.1.2 - Traversing an array with an indexed for loop or while loop requires elements to be accessed using their indices 
6.2.1.3 - Since the indices for an array start at 0 and end at the number of elements − 1, “off by one” errors are easy to make when traversing an array, resulting in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException being thrown 
6.3 - Enhanced for Loop for Arrays  
6.3.1 - Traverse the elements in a 1D array object using an enhanced for loop
6.3.1.1 - An enhanced for loop header includes a variable, referred to as the enhanced for loop variable 
6.3.1.2 - For each iteration of the enhanced for loop, the enhanced for loop variable is assigned a copy of an element without using its index 
6.3.1.3 - Assigning a new value to the enhanced for loop variable does not change the value stored in the array 
6.3.1.4 - Program code written using an enhanced for loop to traverse and access elements in an array can be rewritten using an indexed for loop or a while loop 
6.4 - Developing Algorithms Using Arrays  
6.4.1 - For algorithms in the context of a particular specification that requires the use of array traversals: (a) Identify standard algorithms, (b) Modify standard algorithms, (c) Develop an algorithm
6.4.1.1 - There are standard algorithms that utilize array traversals to: (a) Determine a minimum or maximum value, (b) Compute a sum, average, or mode, (c) Determine if at least one element has a particular property, (d) Determine if all elements have a particular property, (e) Access all consecutive pairs of elements, (f) Determine the presence or absence of  duplicate elements, (g) Determine the number of elements meeting specific criteria

Unit 7 - Array List
7.1 - Introduction to ArrayList  
7.1.1 - Represent collections of related object reference data using ArrayList objects
7.1.1.1 - An ArrayList object is mutable and contains object references
7.1.1.2 - The ArrayList constructor ArrayList() constructs an empty list 
7.1.1.3 - Java allows the generic type ArrayList<E>, where the generic type E specifies the type of the elements 
7.1.1.4 - When ArrayList<E> is specified, the types of the reference parameters and return type when using the methods are type E 
7.1.1.5 - ArrayList<E> is preferred over ArrayList because it allows the compiler to find errors that would otherwise be found at run-time 
7.2 - ArrayList Methods  
7.2.1 - Represent collections of related object reference data using ArrayList objects
7.2.1.1 - The ArrayList class is part of the java.util package.  An import statement can be used to make this class available for use in the program 
7.2.1.2 - The following ArrayList methods—including what they do and when they are used—are part of the Java Quick Reference: (a) int size() - Returns the number of elements in the list, (b) boolean add(E obj) - Appends obj to end of list; returns true, (c) void add(int index, E obj) - Inserts obj at position index (0 <= index <= size), moving elements at position index and higher to the right (adds 1 to their indices) and adds 1 to size, (d) E get(int index) - Returns the element at position index in the list, (e) E set(int index, E obj) — Replaces the element at position index with obj; returns the element formerly at position index E remove(int index) — Removes element from position index, moving elements at position index + 1 and higher to the left (subtracts 1 from their indices) and subtracts 1 from  size;  returns the element formerly at position index 
7.3 - Traversing ArrayLists  
7.3.1 - For ArrayList objects: (a) Traverse using a for or while loop, (b) Traverse using an enhanced for loop
7.3.1.1 - Iteration statements can be used to access all the elements in an ArrayList. This is called traversing the ArrayList 
7.3.1.2 - Deleting elements during a traversal of an ArrayList requires using special techniques to avoid skipping elements 
7.3.1.3 - Since the indices for an ArrayList start at 0 and end at the number of elements − 1, accessing an index value outside of this range will result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException being thrown 
7.3.1.4 - Changing the size of an ArrayList while traversing it using an enhanced for loop can result in a ConcurrentModificationException being thrown. Therefore, when using an enhanced for loop to traverse an ArrayList, you should not add or remove elements 
7.4 - Developing Algorithms Using ArrayLists  
7.4.1 - For algorithms in the context of a particular specification that requires the use of ArrayList traversals: (a) Identify standard algorithms, (b) Modify standard algorithms, (c) Develop an algorithm

Unit 8 - 2D Arrays       
8.1 - 2D Arrays  
8.1.1 - Represent collections of related primitive or object reference data using two-dimensional (2D) array objects
8.1.1.1 - 2D arrays are stored as arrays of arrays. Therefore, the way 2D arrays are created and indexed is similar to 1D array objects 
8.1.1.2 - For the purposes of the exam, when accessing the element at arr[first][second], the first index is used for rows, the second index is used for columns 
8.1.1.3 - The initializer list used to create and initialize a 2D array consists of initializer lists that represent 1D arrays 
8.1.1.4 - The square brackets [row][col] are used to access and modify an element in a 2D array 
8.1.1.5 - “Row-major order” refers to an ordering of 2D array elements where traversal occurs across each row, while “column-major order” traversal occurs down each column 
8.2 - Traversing 2D Arrays  
8.2.1 - For 2D array objects: (a) Traverse using nested for loops, (b) Traverse using nested enhanced for loops
8.2.1.1 - Nested iteration statements can be written to traverse the 2D array in “row-major order” or “column-major Order.” 
8.2.1.2 - The outer loop of a nested enhanced for loop used to traverse a 2D array traverses the rows. Therefore, the enhanced for loop variable must be the type of each row, which is a 1D array. The inner loop traverses a single row.  Therefore, the inner enhanced for loop variable must be the same type as the elements stored in the 1D array       
Unit 9 - Inheritance           
9.1 - Creating Superclasses and Subclasses  
9.1.1 -  Create an inheritance relationship from a subclass to the superclass
9.1.1.1 - A class hierarchy can be developed by putting common attributes and behaviors of related classes into a single class called a superclass 
9.1.1.2 - Classes that extend a superclass, called subclasses, can draw upon the existing attributes and behaviors  of the superclass without repeating these in the code 
9.1.1.3 - Extending a subclass from a superclass creates an "is-a" relationship from the subclass to the superclass 
9.1.1.4 - The keyword extends is used to establish an inheritance relationship between a subclass and a superclass. A class can extend only one superclass 
9.2 - Writing Constructors for Subclasses

9.2.1.1 - Constructors are not inherited 
9.2.1.2 - The superclass constructor can be called from the first line of a subclass constructor by using the keyword super and passing appropriate parameters 
9.2.1.3 - The actual parameters passed in the call to the superclass constructor provide values that the constructor can use to initialize the object’s instance variables 
9.2.1.4 - When a subclass’s constructor does not explicitly call a superclass’s constructor using super, Java inserts a call to the superclass’s no-argument constructor
9.2.1.5 - Regardless of whether the superclass constructor is called implicitly or explicitly, the process of calling superclass constructors continues until the Object constructor is called. At this  point, all of the constructors within the hierarchy execute beginning with the Object constructor 
9.3 - Overriding Methods  
9.3.1 - Create an inheritance relationship from a subclass to the Superclass
9.3.1.1 - Method overriding occurs when a public method in a subclass has the same method signature as a public method in the superclass 
9.3.1.2 - Any method that is called must be defined within its own class or its superclass 
9.3.1.3 - A subclass is usually designed to have modified (overridden) or additional methods or instance Variables 
9.3.1.4 - A subclass will inherit all public methods from the superclass; these methods remain public in the subclass 
9.4 - super Keyword  
9.4.1 - Create an inheritance relationship from a subclass to the superclass
9.4.1.1 - The keyword super can be used to call a superclass's constructors and methods

9.5.1.1 - When a class S “is-a” class T, T is referred to as a superclass, and S is referred to as a subclass 
9.5.1.2 - If S is a subclass of T, then assigning an object of type S to a reference of type T facilitates Polymorphism 
9.5.1.3 - If S is a subclass of T, then a reference of type T can be used to refer to an object of type T or S 
9.5.1.4 - Declaring references of type T, when S is a subclass of T, is useful in the following declarations: (a) Formal method parameters, (b) arrays — T[] var ArrayList<T> var 
9.6 - Polymorphism  
9.6.1 - Call methods in an inheritance relationship
9.6.1.1 - Utilize the Object class through inheritance
9.6.1.2 - At compile time, methods in or inherited by the declared type determine the correctness of a non-static method call 
9.6.1.3 - At run-time, the method in the actual object type is executed for a non-static method call 
9.7 - Object Superclass  
9.7.1 - Call Object class methods through inheritance
9.7.1.1 - The Object class is the superclass of all other classes in Java
