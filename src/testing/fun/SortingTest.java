/*
 * SortingTest - seful methods for sorting arrays and lists of data. This is 
 * the student requested review of the sorting concepts as needed for the AP 
 * exam (from the AP Computer Science curriculum). 
 *
 * In the A.P. Computer Science A curriculum in Units 7 and 9, students will 
 * notice that the term "sorting" comes up as something potentially they 
 * can be tested on. For example it states: "Apply selection sort and 
 * insertion sort algorithms to sort the elements of array or ArrayList 
 * objects", "Selection sort and insertion sort are iterative sorting 
 * algorithms that can be used to sort elements in an array or ArrayList", 
 * "Recursive algorithms, such as sorting and searching algorithms, often 
 * produce a result much more quickly than iterative solutions", "Apply 
 * recursive algorithms to sort elements of array or ArrayList objects", 
 * and "Merge sort is a recursive sorting algorithm that can be used to 
 * sort elements in an array or ArrayList". 
 * 
 * However, with more analysis of these curriculum points, more specifics 
 * can be drawn out. Since the curriculum document is vague about it, I would 
 * interpret what you need to know about sorting is:
 * 
 * (1) That their are different sorting algorithms, for example selection 
 *     sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, and merge sort
 * (2) Some sorting algorithms can be implemented recursively to array and/or
 *     ArrayLists of data
 * (3) Not necessarily know how to write these sorting algorithms (even 
 *     though we will in this example)
 *
