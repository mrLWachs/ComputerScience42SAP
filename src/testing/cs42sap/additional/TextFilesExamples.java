/**
 * TextFilesExamples.java - This class is an example of some of the new 
 * additional content added to the CS42SAP course. This will entail Mr. Wachs 
 * leading students in direct instruction (lessons) in materials that fills any 
 * gaps in knowledge from the course work done with Mr. Wachs (CS20S, CS30S, 
 * and CS40S) as it relates to the AP Computer Science curriculum by having 
 * presentations, doing examples, and making notes. 
 * 
 * Apps you have previously created stored data in memory as primitive data 
 * structures (e.g. variables and arrays), more advanced data structures 
 * (e.g. classes), or even abstract dynamic data structures (e.g. 
 * collections). Problem with this is that they are only temporary (once the 
 * device’s power is off the data is lost - called “volatile” data). To save 
 * permanently, we need to create or open a file on the device’s file system 
 * and write data from data structures into that file (called “non-volatile” 
 * data). Once your app restarts, it opens the file and reads the data out 
 * and back into the memory data structures of the app. Every computing 
 * device (e.g. desktop, laptop, tablet, smart phone, game console, smart 
 * car, etc.) has a file system which is organized and controlled by that 
 * device’s operating system (OS). Most of these OS file systems access a 
 * permanent (non-volatile) medium (like a hard drive, etc.) which can store 
 * non-volatile data. Although each OS has unique qualities, many of the 
 * protocols (rules) used are similar. For example, the way files are named 
 * must be unique. Files are separate from your application but connected 
 * to it (to read/write data to/from the file). Complex apps can be 
 * associated with multiple files that might be reading and/or writing to 
 * multiple files at the same time – and, multiple applications might access 
 * the same file(s).
